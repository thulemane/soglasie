<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">They
who desire to have the most true knowledge of the greater science of
the philosophical Art, let them diligently peruse this little book and
often times read it over and they shall obtain their prosperous and
wished desire. Listen to these things, you children of the Ancient
Philosophers, I will speak in the loudest and highest voice I can, for
I come unto you to open and declare the principal state of human things
and the most secret treasure of all the secrets of the whole world. I
will not do it feignedly and erroneously but altogether plainly and
truly, wherefore use you towards me such devotion of hearing as I shall
bring unto you magistery of doctrine and wisdom, for I will show you a
true testimony of those things which I have seen with my own eyes and
felt with my hands. There are many men too forward as deceitful
boasters which after great expenses and labours, find out no effect but
misery. I will therefore speak plainly and manifestly so that the
unskillful, as those that are expert and skilful, shall be able to
understand the secret of this mystery. Neither shall any man justly use
slanderous and blasphemous words against me, for seeing that the
Ancient Philosophers have written so obscurely and confusedly that they
are not understood, nor seem not to agree together, because diverse men
searching after this most precious Art have either been deceived or
terrified from their purpose, therefore without all deceit or
obscurity, I will plainly set down the true experiment before your
eyes, together with the opinions of the Philosophers, serving well for
our purpose that the matter whereof we entreat may be manifest and
plainly understood.</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">First
we must note that all men which work beyond nature are deceivers and
work in an unlawful manner. Furthermore, of man nothing is born but
man, and of a brute beast nothing but a brute beast, and every like
bringeth forth nothing but his like, wherefore he which have not of his
own, cannot at his pleasure have another man's. We speak this that no
man should let his money go from him. For some men being deceived by
letting their money pass from them, and so living in penury, do also
endeavour to seduce other men and to bring them to like misery. But my
counsel is that no man be too forward in this art, in hope to attain
some great matter, unless he knows the beginning of true nature and the
regimen thereof, which being known there is not then any need of more
things than one, neither doth it require great expenses, because it is
one stone, one medicine, one vessel, one regimen, and one disposition,
and know this: that it is a most true Art. Furthermore the Philosophers
would never have laboured and studied to express such diversities of
colours and the order of them unless they had seen and felt them.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Wherefore
again we say this, that all men labouring beyond nature are deceivers
and deceived. Therefore let your exercise and labour be used in Nature
because Our Stone is of an Animal, of a Vegetable, and of a Mineral
substance. Be thou therefore of one mind and opinion in the work of
nature and presume not to try this thing here and that thing another
time, for our Art is not effected with the multitude of things and
though the names thereof be diverse and manifold, yet it is always one
only thing and of one thing. For that is not brought into nature which
being in it is not of its own nature, therefore it is necessary that
the Agent and Patient be One thing, and the same thing in kind or in
general, but in species another and diverse, according to Mercury by
which the woman is diversified from the man, because, although they
agree in one kind, yet they have a distinct difference between
themselves, as Matter and Form differ, for Matter suffers action but
Form works and makes the Matter like itself. Therefore, Matter
naturally desires Form, as the woman does the man, and the foul does
the fair, so the body embraceth the spirit more freely that it may come
to its perfection. Therefore, by knowing the natural roots you shall
the better make your work of them. Because I cannot any other way
express or explain our stone, nor form it by any other name, it is
manifest by that which went before, that our stone is compounded of
four elements, both rich and poor have it, and it is found in every
place, it is likened to all things and is also compounded of body, soul
and spirit and it is altered from nature into nature even to the last
degree of his perfection.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">They
have also said that our stone is made of one thing and it is true for
the whole magistery is done with our water, for that water is the sperm
of all metals, and all metals are resolved into it, as has been
declared.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Likewise,
the salt of metals is the stone of the Philosophers, for our stone is a
water congealed into Gold and Silver and resists the fire and is
resolved again into its water of which it is compounded in its kind.
Therefore, the reduction of bodies into their first matter as into
Argent vive is nothing else but a resolution of the congealed matter by
which a lock is opened by the ingression of one nature into another.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Whereupon,
the Philosophers have said that Sol is nothing else but ripened Argent
vive, for in Mercury there are but two elements in act, that is to say
earth and water which are passives, but the active elements as air and
fire are in that might and power only because those things are brought
from power into act in pure Mercury according to due digestion and
proportionable decoction, then Gold is made. Wherefore there are four
elements in Gold made fit in equal proportion and therefore ripe and
active Sulphur is there, and our Art helpeth nature by her ministering
ripe Gold to Mercury, in which is ripe and well digested Sulphur, but
from nature by the work of nature.</p>

is a double way in this art according to the Philosophers, that is -
universal and particular. The universal way is easy and rare, and it is
that which is brought forth from true and natural beginnings, by which
a speedy and reformative virtue doth presently and in a moment hardens
Mercury, and it tinctureth any metal that is duly prepared, into true
Gold or Silver.</p>

the second way is called particular and it is hard and laboursome. Note
this, although Alchemy in the universal way be partly natural and
partly artificial, yet it is more natural than otherwise, because by
nature no strange or foreign thing is brought in the way of true
Alchemy, for nature hath whereon to work because actives are joined to
passives by a competent union and application, but the rest nature
worketh by herself.</p>

are three sorts of labourers according to the art of Alchemy, that is
the Alchimist, the Lauchimist, and the Lachrymist. Not every one who
sayeth "Take, Take", shall enter into this art, because it is one only
receipt, and one body entereth not into another.</p>

the imperfect body is converted into the first matter, and those waters
being conjoined with our water do make one pure and clear water,
purifying all things and yet containing in itself all necessary things.
And this water of which and with which our magistery is effected, is
both dear and cheap, for it dissolveth bodies not with common solution
as the ignorant report, which converts the body into cloud water, but
by the true philosophical solution, in which the body is changed into
its first water of which it hath been from the beginning this self same
body. That is, the water transforms bodies into Ashes. But know this,
that the Art of Alchemy is a gift of the Holy Ghost and know that in
our days we have had Master Arnold de Villa Nova in the Roman Court, a
great Physician and Divine, who hath also been a notable Alchimist, who
made small wedges of gold which wedges he granted to be put to any
trial.</p>

the Artificers of Alchemy know this, that the forms of metals cannot be
transmuted unless they be reduced into their first matter, and then
they are transmuted into another form than that which they had before.
And that is because the corruption of one thing is the generation of
another thing, as well in artificial things as in natural things. For
Art imitates nature and in certain things it correcteth it and
excelleth it as nature is helped by the industry of the Physician.</p>

use nature well because nature cannot be amended but in its own nature,
to which bring in no foreign thing, neither powder, nor any other
thing, because diverse natures do not make perfect the stone, neither

or strange thing be put into it, it is straight corrupted and that
which is sought shall not be obtained.</p>

I give you to understand that, unless you take like things in the
beginning of the decocting and guide them subtly until they all be made
water, till then you have not found out the work. Wherefore, I will
make the precious secret known unto the students thereof, they they
shall not be wearied in vain, because this magistery is nothing else
but to decoct Argent vive and Sulphur, until the Argent vive be made
all one, which defendeth the Sulphur from burning if the vessel be well
closed, so that the Argent vive may not vanish away nor the Sulphur be
burned or consumed, because our Argent vive is our pure water. And we
see the example in common water, that every thing which is decocted in
it is never burnt till the water is consumed and the fire be very
strong, and when the water is consumed, then that which is in the
vessel is burnt. And therefore, the Philosophers have willed us to stop
the mouth of the vessel close, that our blessed water breath not forth,
but that it may defend that from burning which is in the vessel, but
water being put with these things doth forbid the fire to burn them,
and then those things are done and made. And the greater the flame is,
yet so much the more be hidden in the inward parts, that it be not hurt
by the heat of the fire. The water receiveth them in his belly and
repelleth the flame of the fire from them. But I would wish all the
searchers after this Art, in the beginning to make a soft fire, till
patience be made between the water and the fire, and after you shall
see the water fixed without any ascending, then you need not care in
what sort the fire be, but yet it is good to govern it with patience,
till the spirit and body be made all one, so that the corporate bodies
be made incorporate, and the incorporate be made corporate. Therefore,
water is the thing which maketh white and red. It is the water which
killeth and reviveth. It is the water which burneth and maketh hot. It
is the water which dissolveth and congealeth. It is the water which
putrefieth and afterwards causeth new and contrary things to spring up.
Wherefore, my son, I counsel thee that all thy labour and diligence be
used in the decocting of the water. And let it not be irksome unto thee
if thou desire to have the fruit thereof and take care for no other
vain matters, but for water only. Decoct that water by little and
little, by putrefying until it be changed from colour into a perfect
colour, and take care that in the beginning you burn not the flowers
and greenness thereof, and be not too hasty in bringing your work to
pass, and remember that your door be well and firmly shut, that he
which is within fly not out and thus by the help of God you shall
obtain a wished effect. Nature makes her operation by little and
little, therefore, I would also that you should do so, yea rather let
your imagination be according to nature, and see according to nature,
of which bodies are regenerated according to nature in the bowels of
the earth. Imagine this by true imagination and not phantastically and
likewise see in what colour the decoction of them is made, in whether
it be violent or pleasant.</p>

have considered in our volumes of the secret and natural powers and of
the properties of natural things, and by our own experience of the
invention of the searching out of a matter altogether certain. We have
not found out any other thing but only those things of which our
medicine is made, that it may have these properties in itself in
transmuting of bodies.<br>First, that it may have a most subtle earth in itself, and incombustible and apt to fix anything with its own radical moisture.<br>Secondly,
that it may have an airy and fiery moisture uniformly conjoined, so
that if one be volatile the rest may be so also, and because that
moisture above all other moistures abideth all other moistures, to the
accomplishment of this sufficient thickness of ashes so far forth as
the want thereof, with an unseparable permanency of the earth that is
annexed without evaporation.<br>Thirdly, because the natural
disposition of moisture is such that by the benefit of its homogeneity
it hath in all differences of its properties, annexed earth by the
conversion of them both, because in the homogeneity of either of them
it is tempered virtuously with an inseparable bond of conjoining, and
after the degree of final preparation it yieldeth good melting.<br>Fourthly,
that this homogeneity is of such purity of Essence and artificially
purified from all combustible and burnt substance, that all things
which are joined with it are not burnt by it, but it preserveth them
from burning.<br>Fifthly, because it hath a clear and bright tincture
in itself, white, red, pure, incombustible, stable and fixed, which
neither the fire is able to change nor burnt sulphurs or sharp
corrosives able to corrupt.<br>Sixthly, because the whole engrafted
compound with its final accomplishment is of such subtlety and thinness
of substance, that after the final injection of the term of its
decoction, it remaineth of most thin melting, in manner of water, and
profound penetration even to the permutability of the last thing, of
what fusion or melting so ever it be in the accomplishment, and
cleaveth naturally to its fume with its affinity and nearness, and with
inseparable hardness against the impression of the fire, even in its
hour reducing bodies spiritually into its own nature.</p>

things being considered, we find by our investigation seven necessary
and convenient properties in our stone; Oiliness, Thinness, Affinity of
Substance, Radical Moisture, Purity, Clearness, Fixing Earth and
Tincture.<br>But the first property of differences is that oiliness
giving in projection a universal melting and opening of the medicine.
For surely the sudden and convenient fusion of the medicine is chiefly
necessary after the projection of the medicine which is done and
miscerated with natural oiliness.<br>The second is the thinness of the
matter or the spiritual subtlety thereof, thin and flowing in fusion,
like water penetrating to the bottom of an altering thing, because
secondly after the fusion of the medicine, the ingression thereof is
immediately necessary.<br>The third is affinity or nearness between the
Elixir and the thing to be transmuted, yielding a certain sticking or
holding in the meeting of its like, because thirdly after the
ingression of the medicine, the sticking or holding is convenient and
necessary.<br>The fourth is radical moisture and fiery congealing, and
hardening the refined parts with the adherence of their like and with
an inseparable union of all like parts, because fourthly after the
adherence or sticking, the hardening or solidifying of parts with its
radical and slimy moisture is convenient and necessary.<br>The fifth is
purity and mundified clearness, giving an eminent brightness and
splendour in the present combustion, not to those joined after the
hardening of the purified parts which are left, because the agent and
actual fire may have sufficient to burn all foreign and hardened
superfluities, wherefore putrefaction followeth immediately and is very

well in the art of our magistery, nothing is concealed of the
Philosophers, except the secret of the art, which is not lawful to be
revealed to any man, for he that should do so would be accursed, and
incur the indignation of the Lord and die with the palsy. Wherefore,
all error is in the art, because they take not their due matter out of
it, therefore use reverent nature; of it, by it, and in it, our art is
engendered and in no other thing, and therefore our magistery is a work
of nature and not of a workman. And so he which knoweth not the
beginning, obtaineth not the end, and he which knoweth not what he
seeks is ignorant also what he shall find.</span>

therefore that copper, which is the gold of the Philosophers, is their
gold, but Senior said "Our gold is not common gold". And you have
sought after the greenness, thinking that copper had been a leprous
body by reason of that greenness which it hath. Whereupon, I tell you
that all that is perfect in copper is only that greenness which is in
it, because that greenness is by our magistery quickly turned into our
most pure gold, and this we have tried, but you can by no means prepare
the stone without green and liquid Duenech, which is seen to grow in
our minerals. 0 blessed greenness, which engenders all things. You know
that no vegetable and fruit appeareth in growing but it is of a green
colour. Know therefore, that the generation of this thing is green,
wherefore the Philosophers have called it their growing or springing.
And likewise, they have called it water of their purification or
putrefaction, and they spoke the truth, because it is purified by their
water or purified from its blackness. It is washed and it maketh it
white and afterwards red. Know therefore, that there is no true
tincture, but of our Copper, decoct it therefore with his soul, grind
it, and do thus, until the spirit be conjoined with his body and be
made in one, and you shall have your desire. The wisemen have given
many names to it, but consider you only of that matter which sticketh
to Argent vive and to the bodies, and you shall have the true knowledge
and science. But that you may not err, know therefore what it is to
stick in the bodies. Some have said that common Argent vive sticketh in
the bodies, which is false. For they think that they understand the
chapter of Geber intimating of Argent vive, where he saith, "When we
search in other things, we find out by our searching nothing to be more
friendly to the nature of bodies than Argent vive". But all this must
be understood of the philosophical Argent vive, for it only sticketh in
bodies, and the ancient Philosophers could find out no other thing
which would stick to the bodies but philosophical Argent vive, because
common silver sticketh not in the bodies, but rather the bodies cleave
and stick to Argent vive. And this is true by experience, because if
common Argent vive be conjoined with any body, the Argent vive
remaineth in its own nature, or goeth away and does not turn the body
into its nature. And therefore, it sticketh not unto the bodies but the
bodies cleave and stick to it, and by reason of this many men are
deceived in working in that common Argent vive, because it is clear our
occidental stone exceeding Argent vive, which hath preferred itself
before gold and hath overcome it, is that which killeth and causeth to
revive again. Know therefore, that Argent vive coagulated and mortified
in his own nature, is the father of all the miracles of this our
magistery, and it is a spirit and a body, that is a spiritual body,
because it ascends by sublimation. And this is because Geber said the
consideration of the true thing which doeth all things, is the
consideration of the choice of the pure substance of Argent vive, but
of which especially this substance of Argent vive may be chosen, that
must diligently be sought after. And we answering say that it is chosen
out of those things in which it is.</p>

my son, consider and see where that substance is, and take that and
none other if you desire to come to the true understanding. I tell thee
in the charity of Christ that neither we nor the ancient Philosophers
could ever find any thing persevering and abiding in the fire, but only
that unctuous, perfect and combustible moisture, and that moisture when
it is prepared as it ought to be, it bringeth all bodies which it
touches to a most true compliment of gold, and above all bodies and
especially Luna.</p>

that no solution ought to be made but in the proper and appropriated

that no Dragon Water ought to be made by an alembic, without any other
thing added, and in the making of it there is a great stink.<br>Fourthly,
that with that body of water an Amalgam may be dissolved, as also a
body, a spirit and briefly all things in general, which are of its
nature.<br>Fifthly, that that water ought to be pure and clean, and
therefore should not be made but of a purged Dragon. And let the Dragon
be purged by elevating it three times and then by reviving it.<br>Sixthly, that the dissolved must be purified in warm and moist, that is in horse dung. Of this one blackness riseth.<br>Seventhly, that it be coagulated in the dry Sun, in moisture that is in Balneo Maria.<br>Eighthly,
that the time of the perfection of Elixir is less than one year, yet we
must see that it be the time of the increase of man in the womb of the
mother.<br>Ninthly, that Mercury is by no means killed, but with the
smell of the body, perfected red to red and of white to white. And that
the body can give weight, his own weight remaining, there are four
things with which our work is effected, that is Weight, Fire, Body and
Spirit.<br>Tenthly, that all revived things are not to be refused in the Art.<br>Eleventhly,
that the thing being prepared and put in the vessel, it will then be
women's work and children's play, because the magistery may be done in
one vessel. Likewise, whosoever hath true Mercury, hath Elixir also,
because Elixir is mortified Mercury, or fixed with the smell of the
body, because the Dragon dieth not but with his brother and sister.
Note likewise, that Mercury must altogether be made of the body, that
is, that fixed be made volatile with volatile, that is with pure
Mercury. And it is needful that there be more of the volatile than of
the fixed, from double to fivefold to sixfold unto tenfold, and no
further, and the more volatile parts there are, so much the more slowly
are they fixed, and the fixed is made volatile in the space of one
month. And note that, Elixir cannot be unless the body and spirit pass
through all the Elements. That is, through all natures of Elements,
that first they may be made earth, afterwards air, that is vapour,
thirdly water, and fourthly fire, for everything is called fire which
doth not fly the fire, nor diminish nor consume in the fire.</p>

first matter of bodies is not common mercury, but it is an unctuous and
moist vapour. For of the moist the mineral stone is made, and of the
unctuousness the metallic body. For it is meet that the bodies be
converted into such an unctuous vapour, and in the conversion the
bodies are killed and the grain [seed] of the body is overthrown with
death and altogether mortified, and this is done by the aid of our
white and red water. And understand it, that unless the grain of Corn,
that is the grain of the body, be cast into the earth, that is into its
first water, which is an unctuous vapour or the mercury of the wise men
and of the Philosophers, and such a vapour is called the known Stone in
the chapters of books, and the beginning of the matter of our
operation, and unctuous sulphur out of which the Fifth Essence is
extracted, in the accomplishment Mercury tinctureth every body into Sol
and Luna, according to which way the Stone hath been finally prepared.
Note likewise, that although all ancient wise men of Alchemy have
spoken many things and conclude of Salt, and because they speak of the
Soap of the Wise and the Key that shutteth and openeth and shutteth
again and no man openeth without this Key, they say that no man in this
world can come to the perfection of this Science unless he know to
calcine Salt after its preparation. And they say that it must be in a
temperate place the space of three days, that the heat of the fire and
the fumes may evaporate away. And therefore I conclude of this, that
every good and perfect medicine of Alchemy and Elixir or powder must be
in manner of Salt, and be Salt itself, and have the virtue of Salt in
being of slow fusion and penetrating when cast on the bodies of melted
or fiery metals. And of this Geber warneth us when he sayeth "It is
necessary that the medicine be of a more speedy melting than Mercury,
so that it may sooner melt before the flight of Mercury, and that the
fire may not consume nor destroy it, and then it is called fusible salt
and incombustible oil, and the Soap of the Wise."</p>

likewise, that the Salt of metals transmuteth Mercury into true Sol and
Luna and thus the Salt of Animals transmuteth every animal into true

in the work of the Digestion of our Stone, neither is the fire of
Balneo Maria of any force, although it be most temperate in the place
thereof.</p>

should not work anything but in Sol and Mercury joined together, of
which the Stone of the Philosophers consists. Of perfection, nothing is
made because it is already perfect, as we have an example in bread.
Leavened bread is perfect in its state and essence, and cometh to its
last end, neither can more be leavened by it, as it is in Gold. Pure
Gold is brought by the trial of the fire into a firm and fixed body,
and it is impossible for the Philosophers to ferment or leaven any more
with it, unless the first matter of metals be had, in which Gold may be
resolved into his first matter, and into the mingled elements. Let us
therefore, take that matter whereupon Gold shall be made, and by the
help of workmanship be brought into the true ferment of Philosophers,
and by policy, we may change this into a perfect substance, or into the
spirit of perfect bodies, wherefore, ever many Philosophers labouring
herein are deceived, because they leave off the work, where it should
be begun. 0 ye Sons of Learning who hope to gather the fruit before it
be ripe, and hope to mow before the harvest comes.</p>

that which is perfect nothing can be done or made, because the perfect
forms of things are not changed in their nature but rather corrupted.
Nor of a thing altogether imperfect, can any thing be made according to
Art. The reason is because art cannot induce the first dispositions but
our Stone is a middle thing between perfect and imperfect bodies, and
what nature itself has begun, that is brought to perfection by Art. And
if thou begin to work in Mercury itself, where nature hath left it
imperfect, thou shall find perfection and shall rejoice. That which is
perfect is not altered, but is corrupted, but an imperfect thing may be
well altered. Therefore, the corruption of one thing is the generation
of another thing.</p>

Stone must of necessity be extracted from the nature of two bodies
before the accomplishment of the Elixir can be made of it, because it
is necessary that Elixir be more purged and digested than Gold or
Silver, because it must convert it altogether from his diminished
perfection, into the Gold or Silver of the Philosophers, which those
cannot bring to pass. For if they should give of their perfection unto
another, those would remain imperfect, by reason that they cannot tinct
but as much as they show themselves. Because nothing whiteneth but
according to its own whiteness, neither doth anything make red but
according to its own redness. And therefore, according to this the
works in our Stone are done, that the tincture may be more bettered in
it than in its nature, and that the Elixir may be made according to the

nor fire is a pure element and simple with us, because they are mingled
between themselves by course and especially - in that part where they
conjoin. But the Fifth Essence is a body standing by itself and
differing from all Elements and from things Elementated, as well in
matter as in form, and as well in nature as in virtue, not having the
cause of corruption in itself. And it is called the Fifth Essence,
therefore, because it is extracted out of all Elementated things,
wherefore there is no elemental motion in it as in other Elemental
Bodies. The Stone therefore is called everything because it hath in
itself and of itself every necessary thing of its own perfection. It is
found in every place by reason of the participation of the Elements. It
is called by all names because of the worthy and miraculous variety of
colours of its nature. Most base and cheap by putrefaction, and most
dear by virtue. This is the hidden and Secret Magistery of the
Philosophers. Our Stone is called one thing when the substances of the
body and water are prepared inseparably, so that one of them cannot be
separated from another. Our Stone is said to be of a combustible matter
and Mercury is only a Spirit incombustible and coppery, and therefore
it is meet that it be in the magistery. Likewise, the Stone which the
Philosophers seek, in which the first elements of minerals are,
tincture and calx, soul and spirit with the body fixed and volatile.
And it is not every Mercury, but it is that above which nature hath
determined her first operations into a metallic nature, and hath left
it imperfect. But if you extract this Stone from that thing in which it
is found, and shall begin to work about it to perfection, by beginning
in that place where nature hath left it imperfect, you shall find
perfection in it and shall rejoice.</p>

says Sol and Luna are in our Stone in virtue and power and in all
nature, if this were not so neither Sol nor Luna would be made thereof,
because the Sol and Luna in our Stone are better than the common in the
nature of them, and because Sol and Luna are alone in Our Stone, and
the vulgar are dead in respect of Sol and Luna. Therefore the
Philosophers have named that Stone, Sol and Luna by course, because
they are in it potentially and not visibly, but in virtue and essence.
Wherefore Hermes says, "Our Stone crieth saying, 'Son, help me and I
will help thee.'"</p>

without division.</p>

and Coagulation of the body are two things but they have one operation,
because the spirit is not coagulated, but with the solution of the
body; neither is the body dissolved, but with the coagulation of the
spirit; and the body and soul, when they are conjoined, each of them
goes unto his like. An example - when water is joined to earth, the
water with his moisture and virtue endeavoureth to dissolve the earth,
for it makes it more subtle than it was before, and likewise makes it
like unto itself, because water is more subtle than earth. So the soul
doeth the like in the body, and in the same way the water is thickened
with the earth, and becometh like thickened earth, because the earth is
thicker than the water, therefore there is no difference between the
solution of the body and the coagulation of the spirit nor any contrary
work in either if them; so that the one may be done without the other,
as there is no contrary part of time between the water and the earth in
their conjunction, that the one may be known or separated from the
other in their conjunctions and operations. As the sperm of the man is
not separated from the sperm of the woman in the hour of their
coupling, and so there is one form of them, one deed, one and the self
same operation at once of them both.</p>

philosophical putrefaction is nothing else but a corruption and
destruction of bodies. For one form being destroyed, nature presently
brings into it another form, more better and subtle. Putrefaction is
the same thing that fraction of filthiness is. For by putrefaction
every thing is digested, and fraction is made between that which is
filthy, that which stinks, and that which is pure and clean. For a pure
and clean body being putrefied doth immediately grow and increase, as
is manifest in a grain of corn, which after it has stood many days
under the heat of the earth, then it beginneth to swell, and that which
is pure grows out of it and multiplies, but that which is filthy and
naught, vanishes away. Therefore putrefaction is also necessary in our
work, by reason of the aforesaid causes.</p>

they embrace themselves with such strong knitting and hold themselves
so fast, that the one can hardly be plucked from the other. This would
be much more stronger if one of them were spiritual, that is medicinal,
and so tangible by reason of his spiritualness. Gold is Gold in act and
in matter, but if it were spiritualised, then is made of act - power,
and of matter - form and of a thing done - a thing doing, of a woman -
a man, and of a thing born - a thing bearing. Therefore, since there is
no matter of Gold, no Gold which was not first Silver as the
Philosopher says, if therefore such a form be joined to this matter,
that is to Luna, surely they will most desirously embrace themselves
and make that which is the less perfect more perfect, and this is done
naturally and amicably, because every nature desires to be perfect and
naturally abhors to be destroyed.</p>

men have said that all the colours which may be devised in the world do
appear in the work of the Stone, but that is the deceit of the
Philosophers. For there appear but four principal colours, and because
all the other colours draw their original out of them, therefore they
called them all colours, and although all colours do not appear to thee
yet care not so long as thou mayest segregate the elements. For
yellowness signifies burnt choler and fire. Redness signifies blood and
air. Whiteness, phlegm and water. Blackness melancholy and earth.
Whereupon Hortulanus says there are four Elements, having four colours
and know that the aforesaid colours appear in our dissolution.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">I
demand in what time this blessed Stone may be made, to which it is
answered as a certain author Lelius the Philosopher witnesses, that his
magistery was finished in eight days, and that another did it in seven
days, and another in three months, and some in four months, and some in
half a year, and some in the space of a whole year, and Maria says she
did it in three days. To this I say that the cause of diversity, that
is of shortness and length of time, might be defect in the virtue of
the water of Mercury or because it worketh of Sol and Luna. And some of
the Philosophers added more and some less. But Sol is fixed and not
flying, and with that only did they work. Whereupon, for his impotency
of fixion and impatiency of fire when it was mingled with Sol by
melting, it caused it to ascend for a great part. And when it did
ascend, so they called it water and a soul and a spirit, saying that
their water was not common water nor water of Mercury. And then the
earth remained in the bottom, then they reduced that water above the
body and made it again to ascend by virtue of the fire, and they
mingled it again with earth, until they carried out the earth with them
in their belly. "The wind carried him in his belly." Therefore of
necessity they must have a great quantity of the aforesaid water. And
then the spirit was fixed in the body, therefore they began that
subliming again until all the whole remained fixed and that which was
weak ascended. Then was the spirit fixed in the body, and Luna was
incorporated to Sol and commixed by the least, and so the operation was
finished. Whereupon the aforesaid diversity in working might be in
adding too much of the fixed body and too little of the body not fixed,
and because there was not more of the unfixed body, therefore it
ascended the sooner, and when there was more of the fixed then it
ascended more slowly.</p>

what say you of this? The Philosophers say plainly, "Our Gold is not
the common Gold, and our Silver not common Silver". I say that they
call water Gold because it ascendeth to higher things by the virtue of
the fire, and in truth that Gold is not common Gold, for the common
people would not believe that it could ascend to higher matters by
reason of its fixedness. Know moreover that such a manner hath been
accustomed of the Philosophers, as to halt and dissemble in a most
plain way, and to hide the matter that is spoken of, by figures and
parables and sometimes by metaphorical words and sometimes by false and
strange practise in way of similitudes.</p>

only that knows how to make the Philosophers Stone understandeth their
words concerning the Philosophers Stone. For the Philosophers have
manifestly endeavoured to make this Art known to the worthy and to
conceal it from the unworthy. And so they always speak truth of the
virtue of intention but not of the virtue of speech. And so they say
the Philosophers Stone to be made of an egg, because there are three
things in an egg, which are like to three things which make perfect the
Stone. Hermes says, "Sol is its father and Luna is its mother", and
thus he granteth that two things enter into the composition of the
Stone, and that Hortulanus proves because the water of Sol is volatile
and his body fixed, and in the contrary way with Luna. And then these
words spoken by Geber and other philosophers are declared "make fixed
volatile, and volatile fixed, and fixed volatile". For they persuade
that there is manifest solution, because the whole work consists in
Solution. Likewise when he says that it is superior and inferior,
hereby superior is understood the worthier and inferior the unworthier,
that one may be made of those three or that one thing may be made of
Sol and Luna whose parts are equal. And this conjunction is called the
Sublimation of the Philosophers, and Sublimation is called Exaltation,
or Dignification, because Luna and Mercury are dignified. For when
Union is made in so great dignity, then Luna is as Sol and Mercury.
Likewise when fixation is made which is called the dead body, then Sol
is as base as Mercury.</p>

the Stone is said to have four Elements, which Arnoldus expoundeth.
Because when solution is made then water is called one element, and
when the body is impure, the earth is called the second element, and
when the earth is calcined, it is called fire, and when the Stone is
again dissolved it is called air.</p>

the Stone is said to have body, soul and spirit. By the body we
understand the impure body as was said before, by the soul is
understood the ferment, and by the spirit which hath its being in
projection which is called by another name, Fifth Essence, which this
compostion having gotten, it has the true virtue of converting.</p>

the aforesaid Stone is called Rebis, that is one thing which is made of
two things, that is of body and spirit, or of Sol and Luna of a body
purified and fermented.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Likewise
it is called a Stone found in every place, because of the true
composition, when Sol, Luna and Mercury are conjoined together, the
virtue of the Stone is wholly through the world, in mountains and
plains, that is in bodies and Mercury, and in the Sea, that is in
dissolved water, and flying things take help and nourishment of it.
Things flying are quick Mercury and imperfect bodies which are
converted into Sol and Luna, and it is called Scorpio, that is poison,
because it mortifies itself and reviveth itself again, for that
threefold thing being cast upon Mercury doth revive it, because it
maketh a true body and yet it is called mineral Argent vive of the
Philosophers. But the matter of the Philosophers Stone is water, and it
is understood of the water of these three, as Hortulanus proves,
neither ought there to be more or fewer. And he says that Sol is the
man and Luna the woman, and Mercury the sperm. But that there may be
generation and conception, it is meet that the man be joined to the
woman, and so conception and Impregnation ought to be made before
fermentation, and when the matter is multiplied and fermented, then it
is said that an infant increaseth in the womb of the mother. Hortulanus
and Arnoldus say that the soul is poured into the body and a crowned
king is born.</p>

the book of The Turba of the Philosophers these words are recited,
"dissolve bodies and imbibe the spirit". They say bodies in the plural
because there must be two, and they say spirit in the singular because
it is meet there should be one. And there is no sperm without the
matter of bodies unless Mercury. And when it is said, imbibe the spirit
then that operation is understood which fixes Mercury and the Stone is
multiplied. Multiplied, that is reiterated.</p>

Mercury mortifies the matter of Sol and Luna, the matter remains like
ashes, and it is called of the Philosophers searing or grinding of
them. Of these ashes it is said in the book of the Turba and in the
book of Arnoldus, make no small account of these ashes.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Likewise
the aforesaid ashes,which is of these three things, is called by the
Philosophers an impure body, because it must be decocted and calcined
unto whiteness. Therefore Morienus says in the book of the Turba,
"unless you purify the unclean body and make it white and send a soul
into it, you have directed nothing well in this magistery". And in this
sort there are two had, that is Calcination of the Stone itself and
Fermentation. Calcination, that is in manner of white Ash or earth, or
of white calx by the spirits, which reduction of operation is done and
made with our fire, that is with water of our Mercury.</p>

when it is called tincture it tincteth. It is understood that if this
medicine be calcined, dissolved and coagulated, it is fermented, for
white is made Luna, with Sol it is made Sol.</p>

Geber proves and says, of the medicine of the third order, because both
white and red are one and the same way with Sol and Luna, yet they
differ in fermentation, of which third order this medicine is double,
that is Solary and Lunary, and yet it is in one essence, and the manner
of doing is one. But there is an addition of yellowness, or of yellow
colour of which medicine is perfected of the substance of fixed
Sulphur. That is, either medicine is begun with Sol or Luna, for red
ferment is made with Sol and white with Luna. Sol is taken two ways,
one way for water of Sol, another way for the body of Sol as has been
said before.</p>

when it is said that all colours appear, it is true, because before
fermentation, in calcinations, dissolutions and fixations, all colours
appear.</p>

know that they are the same things which make both white and red,
inwardly and outwardly, that is Sol, Luna, and Mercury. Which three
being dissolved and fermented, he calleth them Argent vive, saying
Argent vive hath in itself, Body, Soul and Spirit.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Likewise decoct the man and the woman together, till they be coagulated and made a Stone.</p>

you must note that Our Elixir is not made but of minerals, and note
moreover, the Dragon dies not unless he be killed by his brother and
sister, and not by one only but by two at once. Sol is the brother and
Luna is the sister.</p>

Arnoldus says, because the Philosophers speak true of the Stone
whatsoever they speak, because they speak of the virtue of speech to
conceal it from the unworthy, but of the virtue of intention they speak
to the worthy and speak a truth. And the Philosophers know that such
matters ought to be declared mystically, as poetry in the manner of a
fable and parable, and when the Philosophers speak of great matters,

I make manifest unto thee by natural knowledge the Secret Stone of the

Riches, the Stone of Charity, and the Stone of Curing all languishing.
And in it is contained every Secret, and it is called the Divine
Mystery given of God, and in the world there is not a more higher
thing, after a rational soul. You must diligently note, I have told you
that our Stone is decked with a threefold garment, that is, divided

body which wanteth a spirit is dark and misty.</p>

Son, I will tell it thee more plainly. One Stone or one thing only,
because the body is reduced into its nature, that is into its water,
that is into its first matter, because the first matter of bodies is an
unctuous and slimy water. Then it is first called one thing when the
substance of the body and the water of Union are inseparably united by
the least parts, and the Philosophical Stone, of which infinite
branches are multiplied, and this is called the known Stone in the
books of the Philosophers. Therefore, my Son, from that Stone is its
own proper water extracted, and in the spirit by manner of separation.
Sublimation which we use is an elevation of unfixed parts but the
unfixed parts are elevated by fume and wind.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">But
we will that those two be fixed together and yield gentle fusion or
melting, and so understand our true and certain sublimation, and the
stone which no man can touch with his tongue. Hermes says, "Divide the
subtle from the gross". Let the earth be calcined and the water
sublimed. The earth remains downwards the water ascends upwards. The
earth is purged by calcination, the water by sublimation, and both by
putrefaction. The water defends the earth that it burns not, the water
is bound by the earth that it fly not, and they both being sufficiently
purged are made one inseperable, because one without the other cannot
be. One part thereof being cast upon an hundred parts of Argent vive,
doth tinct it into true silver, and if it shall be such tincture, one
part of it being turned into red, doth tinct as many parts into true
gold, of which gold there can be no better found, and this is of hidden
nature and gotten by the heat of the fire.</p>

may see therefore that all things are created of water. God divided
this water when he spoke, and commanded part of the water to go into
the dry land, and called it earth. And He preserved the unconverted
water for the earth to be dew and moisten it, because dry earth yields
not much fruit, unless it be oftentimes wetted with rain water, and
without rain water it seldom or never bears fruit.</p>

follows the fourth word and it is that the water, which shall be

is of two sorts. The first is the reviving of the superfluity, that the
pure parts may remain separated from the elemental faeces, so that they
may possess the virtue of the fifth essence, and this sublimation is
the reduction of bodies into a spirit, when as the corporeal thickness
passes into the thinness of the spirit.</p>

second sublimation is extraction, because it is in it, of the nature of
the fifth essence separated from the elemental faeces. But I call the
fifth essence a tincting spirit wherein washing is necessary, that the
unctuousness of Arsenic, or the oily nature of the purest unctuousness,
which bound by his faeces, may be extracted by it, which faeces suffer
it not to be sublimed.</p>

alchemists have endeavoured in mineral bodies like the work of nature
to do that in a short time, which nature does in 1000 years. Whereupon
they have taught to do a certain thing, which transmuteth those bodies
on which it is cast, and this they call Elixir. And it is called a
Stone and no stone. A stone because it is grinded. No stone, because it
is melted and runs without evaporation as gold. Neither is there any
other thing with which that propriety may agree.</p>

Elixir is a thing which is projected upon a greater body and changes
the thing from its nature into another nature, but it is done when the
lesser body and the spirit and the elements and the ferment are
mingled, and there is one confection made of all of them. And Elixir is
a Greek word, which sounds [like] a great treasure, or the best of
treasures. And truly the Elixir, which mingles itself with the body, is
as Tutty with Copper, but the Copper is enervated or grows from that
Tutty, the reason for which that Tutty is an earthly thing, but Elixir
is a spiritual thing, and by the nature of its kind, returned to
another kind.</p>

the first way thus, the spirits are mortified and sublimed, until they
are made clean. After this, one of the generated bodies by nature is
burnt until it may be grinded, then it is calcined until it is made
clean after the manner of a calx.</p>

at length the spirits and bodies so prepared are grinded and imbibed
with the sharp distilled waters. Afterwards they are so long

made fixed.</p>

it is that the White Elixir does not want but three things, that is to
say, Oil, Tincture and Calx, but the Red needs four, that is to say
Oil, Calx, Tincture, and Tincture again which is called fire, and
therefore Avicenna adds, "in which there is not fire ".</p>

the fire is manifold, and the quality of it diverse, distinguished by
certain degrees, for some fire is hot in the first degree, and moist in
the second degree, that is to say of horse dung, the property of which
is that it does not destroy the oil, but increases it by its moistness,
for others destroy it by reason of their dryness. To this fire,
therefore, there is not likened any other fire in the world, unless it
be the material fire of the body of a sound man. But the fire of the
Sun is hot in the same degree, but it is dry. This is that which tames
the thing, and is made of the animated thing, and is nourished as a boy
to whom milk is given in the beginning, for the boy is nourished and
increased out of hot and moist. So the fire of the horse dung increases
the oil with its humidity, but it fastens the stone by its heat being
temperated.<br>There is another fire between these two which is hot and
dry in the second degree, as the fire of a furnace after bread is taken
out. This melts gently and does not burn, because there is not a flame
in it nor the strength of heat, for the heat in declining by little and
little goes back. But if it should stand it would fix the spirit in the
body, or without the body. But the fire of the horse dung, neither
melts nor burns, but tames and increases the moistness.<br>There is a
fourth fire of the furnace of the fixing, this melts and fixes, but it
does not burn because it is not flammable, nor differs from the
foregoing, unless it be in that there is a continual heat, which is not
in the foregoing.<br>The fifth fire is flaming, and it is hot and dry
in the third degree. This only calcines and does not melt, that is, for
the making of gold and silver, and of other bodies, in the same degree
or further. And it is a fire in the furnace of calcination.<br>The
sixth is hot and dry in the fourth degree, and this melts and fixes
strongly by mollifying the bodies sweetly. Neither does it separate or
disperse them. This is fire of the furnace of melting in the same
degree.<br>The seventh fire is a fire of leaves which dissipates and disperses and melts bodies.<br>The
eighth is that which melts and calcines, and it is flaming because
flame only has his operation in it. Coals and flames is the substance
of fire, and in that flame only of wood. This is also in the same
degree with the fires going before.<br>The ninth also is in the same
degree, that is, which is master to them all, as the fire of office,
that is of trial. This melts and burns, and dissipates and disperses
that which is bad, it saves and rectifies that which is good, it is as
it were a judge discerning the good from the bad.</p>

Artificial fire lasting in what degree you will have it, by the space

must always keep them covered, and you may augment or diminish your
heat according to your pleasure, and that is according to the addition
of more or less kindled coals.</p>

see that you have sufficient store of ashes, made only of the wood of
Juniper, then have a great earthen vial, and in the midst thereof, let
there be another glass or crucible, and put in the ashes and set the
great vial over the heat of the fire, until the ashes wax hot and so
surround the lesser vial, and set coals made only of wood of the
aforementioned Juniper upon those ashes, and you must have more hot
ashes of the same wood, which you must sprinkle on the aforesaid coals,
and cover them with their ashes made very hot, and have you matter to
be put into that lesser pot or glass, and put a cover on the greater
glass and set it on a stone under a bench or on a bench but upon a
stone, lest by some chance misfortune happen to it. By such practise
you may prepare many such fires. You may likewise put hot water into
the lesser glass, or the moist belly of the horse, and into it the vial
of the matter.</p>

shall make the aforesaid coals in this manner. Cut wood of Juniper into
small pieces of the thickness of two fingers or more, put them into a
great pot well stopped and luted on every side, and filled up to the
top. Set that pot, the space of one whole day, over a strong fire of a
furnace of wind or flame of wood, and let it cool by itself. Then open
the glass, and that you shall have that you desire, but you must burn
the ashes after the common order. This fire may be fire of the first or
second degree of fixing of spirits.</p>

is of that into which it is dissolved. For as ice is converted into
water by means of the heat, therefore of necessity it must be water
before it be ice. So all metals have first been argent vive, which is
manifest, because when they melt in the fire, they are converted into
it. Note here that the Philosophers calleth a liquid metal Mercury or
Argent vive, therefore the reduction of metals into Argent vive in this
sort is called that melting, although it may be done by violence of the
fire. But because in that strong liquefaction it retain the form of
Argent vive, therefore he nameth it Argent vive, but that is not the
philosophical solution but that of the layman.</p>

nature desires naturally to be finished and abhors to be destroyed, and
flies away. Therefore nature embraces that greedily which is agreeable
with her, and as much as she can, refuses that which is contrary to
her. And according to that, Art ought to imitate nature, for otherwise
it always errs.</p>

worse thing labouring in any art, does of his own natural malice
endeavour to destroy that which is better. Every better thing labouring
in any art, endeavours to make perfect that which is worse. Therefore,
first of all thou must know the natures of things, that you may discern
what is better and what is worse for nature, and where it may be
perfected and where hindered, and that the quality of the worse exceed
not the quality of the better, for otherwise you shall err greatly.</p>

that is dry does naturally desire to drink his moisture, that it may be
continuated in his parts. Here note, what is the radical moisture of
all melting things, and feed with such moisture the overdried, and it
will be made temperate, and thus you shall have your desire.</p>

that it does not, because every common sulphur, according to the
Philosopher, is strange and contrary to metals.</p>

says that, that enters not into the magistery which is not sprung from
it, because it always infects and makes black and corrupts however it
be prepared by workmanship. For it is an infection of the fire and
therefore hinders the melting, but if it be calcined it goes into an
earthy substance, like dead powder. How can it therefore inspire life
into another thing, for it hath a double superfluity that is, an
unflammable substance and an earthy feculency. Therefore consider by
those things, that common Sulphur is not the Sulphur of the
Philosophers, when as the Sulphur of Philosophers is a simple, quick
fire, reviving other dead bodies and ripening them, so that it supplies
the defect of nature, when, as it is of a superfluous ripeness
according to that which is perfect in nature, and by workmanship is
more and more purified.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Whereupon
Avicenna says, such Sulphur is not found on the earth, but as much as
is in these bodies Sol and Luna, and that is in another thing which is
told unto no man, unless it be revealed by God himself. In Sol it is
more perfect because it is more digested and decocted. For the
Philosophers have subtly imagined how those sulphurs might be chosen in
those more perfect bodies, and to purge their qualities by Art, that
they might have this art by the help of nature which has not appeared
in them before, although they have first had it fully and secretly. And
they grant that this cannot be done without the dissolving of the body
and reduction of it into his first matter, which is Argent vive of
which they are made from the beginning, and that without any mixture of
foreign things. Which foreign things do no way perfect our Stone,
because there is nothing convenient for it but that which is by
affinity near unto it, when, as it is a medicine of a virtuous and
simple nature, drawn out of Mercury water, in which gold and silver are
first dissolved. For instance, if ice be put into simple water, it is
dissolved in it by heat, and returns into its first watery substance,
and so water is tincted even by a secret virtue which was in the ice,
but if ice be not resolved into water by heat, it is not joined to the
water, but lies in the water; neither does it tinct the water by its
virtue, which before was coagulated in it. So in the same way, if you
resolve not the body into Mercury, with Mercury, you cannot have the
secret virtue from it, that is Sulphur digested and decocted into
minerals by the work of nature. For so it is one Stone, one Medicine,
which according to the Philosophers is called Rebis, of a twofold
thing, that is, of a body and a spirit, white and red, in which many of
the ignorant have erred.</p>

it is said that the Sulphur of the Philosophers is red in Sol by
greater digestion, and Sulphur, white in Luna, by lesser digestion.
Whereupon the Philosopher says Citrination is no other thing than
completed digestion, for heat going into moisture, first engenders
blackness, and going into dryness causes whiteness, because the fire if
it transcends the agent in it changes it into a most pure citrineness.
All these things may be done in the calcining of lead. And the
Philosopher says that now in act everyone of the perfect bodies
contains his good Sulphur with Mercury, that is golden gold and silvery
silver. Therefore white Sulphur by citrine is Gold, where the Sulphur
in it is red Sulphur, the substance of the fire, which has more
digested this white, and so Sulphur white and red of either part is in
Sol. Wherefore the fire is its perfection, and in fire it is
engendered, and therefore it rejoices friendly with the nature of its
fiery nature.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Whereupon
no foreign thing can cause this in bodies, when as art is nothing else
by the help of nature, but a decoction and digestion of that nature by
simple labour. For instance, in the morning when I rise and see my
urine white, I judge that I have slept but a little, then I lay myself
down again to sleep, and after I have slept, my urine is citrinated,
and by this reason of a greater digestion of natural heat being in me.
So follow nature by art, in like sort to decoct it, to digest it, to
ripen it, and to sublime it, seeing that nature in act contains in
itself a natural fire with which it is ripened. Those things have not
this and therefore they cannot give it. In Luna there is nothing but
white Sulphur, simple, but not digested like red, nor so purged from
blackness by the working of heat, which it contains naturally in
itself, but the form of fire is covered and hidden, working more in art
than in nature. And therefore it is not impossible, that Art may do it
by the help of nature, but by itself it cannot be, unless it be moved
by art and operation. But those labours (as I think), come not to a man
of an hard brain, and therefore true Gold is not made unless it be so
digested and decocted, that the better may better the worse, because
the intent of all the Philosophers is to effect it with the better,
which the ignorant sort understand contrarily, because they endeavour
to bring to pass the better with the worse, and this they seek in a
thing which never was in it, that Gold and Silver in adustible things
as hath been before explained.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><b>That it is not profitable to seek this Sulphur in some sick bodies because it is not there.</b><br>It
may worthily be demanded, whether this white and red Sulphur to tinct
Mercury, may be chosen out of some sick bodies. I say that it cannot,
because it has been before said, that there is not any thing of a
greater temporancy, than is found in these two bodies, in which the
tincting beams are. Whereas it has been said that sick bodies contain
in themselves stinking and adustible Sulphur, and not of a virtuous
nature as in those. Whereas every art is not of force, but by what
nature had before, from which it follows, you may purge metals by the
lesser minerals. Which being purged yet they should not have that
golden and silvery nature in themselves, because golden digestion and
decoction have not been in them as in others, nor Sulphur so ripe. And
therefore we must help these which be unripe with those that are ripe,
that they may be ripened. Therefore they tinct not but they are
tincted, because the tinctures of gold and silver have a proportionable
nature with them, that is with the unripe and the imperfect, because
they have drawn their original from Mercury. By this it manifestly
appears that the lesser minerals cannot tinct, because the imperfect
metallic bodies, which agree not with Gold or Silver of the part of
ripe Mercury, cannot tinct nor receive the nature of Gold or Silver,
and therefore is not to be tincted, but in those, in which the virtue
of tincting is tincted therefore with Gold and Silver, because Gold
gives a golden colour and nature and Silver a silvery colour and
nature. Wherefore neglect all other things which have not naturally the
virtue of tincting, as there is no fruit in them, but only destruction
of things and gnashing of teeth.</p>

Sons, there are seven bodies of Philosophers of which their gold is the
chief, the king and head, which neither the earth corrupts, nor any
burning thing burns, nor water alters, because his complexion is
temperate and his nature direct in heat, cold, moisture and dryness.
Neither is there anything in it that is superfluous, nor any thing too
little. Wherefore, the Philosophers have brought it forth and magnified
it, and they have said that Gold is in the same sort in bodies, as Sol
in the stars with his glorious light and shining, for by it vegetables
spring in the earth and all fruit is brought forth by the will of God.
In like sort, gold in bodies contains every body with itself and
receives them, because it is the ferment of the Elixir, without which
nothing is done. For as dough without a leaven cannot be leavened nor
seasoned, so when you will make white, sublime, mundify and extract the
faeces and filthiness from them, and [you] will make them fit, conjoin
and mingle them together, then put ferment to them, and look in what
sort the ferment of dough is, so in the same sort is this ferment.
Meditate therefore, and contemplate whether the ferment be of the thing
or else of its nature. This is the key of all the Philosophers, and we
must note that ferment whitens confection, forbids combustion, and
holds tincture that it flies not away, it softens bodies and makes them
enter by course and conjoins them.</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><b>Raimund says in his Apertory:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Now
by the second part the Stone will colour itself, it is fixed and
fermented, but the ferment of the stone for white is Silver, and for
red it is Gold, as the Philosophers declare, because without ferment
neither Sol nor Luna cometh, nor anything else that is of his nature.
Join, therefore, ferment with his sulphur, that it may engender its
colour, and likewise come to its nature, weight, sound and savour,
because every like engendereth its like, and ferment tincteth as Sol
and changeth his Sulphur into a permanent and penetrating medicine.
Therefore the Philosopher says, he that knows to tinct Sulphur and
Argent vive, attaineth the greatest secret, for this cause it is meet
that Sol and Luna be in the tincture and the ferment of that spirit,
and of the permanent water of Argent vive. And by that water these
natures ought to be fixed and nourished with natural heat until they
shall have fixation and melting perfect. After this is made the Regimen
of the Conjunction of the Stone with its ferment, that is until the
work is come to its full accomplishment and this is not done at one
time all together, because this is not of the intent of nature but to
have it well by coupling, that is a little, and then a little again,
and also by coagulation the true unformal medicine is made. And for
this, that copulation is caused of the subtle parts transmuted and
altered into a spiritual form and essence, because it is written that
the thick and gross body with the subtle, and the subtle with the thick
and gross, cannot conjoin themselves by reason of their contrariety,
unless that which is gross be converted into his subtleness by his
subtle spirit, and then they are to be mingled together. And this the
Philosophers notify by declaring to a follower of the truth, and they
say that perfect mixture is the union of mingled and altered bodies
joined to themselves by things not to be divided, because these things
are here required by manifest reason. Because mixture or union cannot
be done or made without alteration which is subtlization of the body
and reduction of it into spiritual form.</p>

concerning that part the Philosophers do say that now the medicine is
finished from one manner into another crystalline manner, and then it
will appear, because that plate is without division of those parts, by
little and little. For that, such a cause cannot be done or made
without the subtlization and homogeneity of nature, and for this cause
it is meet that this matter may become so subtle, that all parts in
nature may be equally mixed with water. And, this you may see by your
understanding, when one body is made transparent and continuated into
one by conjunction or commixtion of many parts without division,
discontinuation and termination, into one thickness and transparent
figure throughout all its parts.</p>

amended, because gold is the headstall of Argent vive and none congeals
Argent vive unless in the body of magnesia, in which there is one
burning thing, and another a flying thing, and the gold itself is the
third thing receiving the tinctures of them and is the tincture of

example from minerals - Salts, Inks, Alums, Arsenic, Auripigment. All
metals are ductile and liquefiable which draw their original from
Mercury, because the matter of them, out of a watery substance mixed
with an earthy substance, by a strong commixtion that the one cannot be
separated from the other, wherefore that watery substance is congealed
with cold more after the action of heat and therefore they will be more
fabrile or ductile, and the water only is not congealed but only with
the earthly dryness which alters the wateryness, when as there is no
unctuous moisture in them, because the congealing of them is of earthly
dryness. Therefore they are not easily dissolved unless by the vehement
action of the heat in them, according to which they are most easily
commixt. But there are lesser and and middle minerals which take not
their original from Mercury, and of these are Salts which easily melt
in moisture, as Alum, simple Salt, Salt Armonick, stony Salt and all
kinds of salts. And surely they have virtue in them. Neither do they
easily melt with moisture only, as Auripigmentum, Arsenic and Sulphur,
when as the wateryness of sulphurous bodies is mixed with slimy earth,
by strong commixtion, with the fervency of heat, until they be made
virtuous and then they are coagulated of cold. But Inks are compounded
of salts, sulphur and stones, and it is thought that a mineral strength
of certain liquid bodies is in them, which they are made of, as
Calcanthum and Olocari. But metallic bodies cannot artificially be made
of them, when as they are of another nature, and with metals being of
the first near nature, that is they take their original with Mercury,
that is of Argent vive. I deny not, but that metals may be purged and
dissolved with them, only a sophistical form be brought into them to
deceive men.</p>

are two sorts of sulphur, that is, living and burning. That which is
living causes metals, although they yet differ one from another, the
second because it is more infected with the sliminess of the earth,
when as simple living sulphur causing gold and silver, is nothing but a
vapour hot and dry, engendered of the most pure terrestrial dryness, in
which the fire bears all the sway, and that is called an element with
the Mercury of metals.</p>

because in the chapter going before it hath been determined that it is
impossible the lesser minerals are to be made metals, therefore here it
remains first to be proved in this way. Because the lesser metals are
engendered of the first matter of metals, which is Mercury, because the
generation of them differ in the first with the generation of Mercury,
in form, in nature and in composition and therefore cannot be made
metals, because it is one first matter and sperm of one form of things,
of which they are engendered. The first part of that which went before
is manifest, that the lesser minerals are not engendered of Mercury,
because they continually remain in the first matter of metals.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Whereupon
Aristotle and Avicenna say, therefore if they should be made metals,
then it is meet that first they pass into the first matter of metals.
But because this cannot be done artificially, therefore metals cannot
be made of them. Thus far hath the first part of that which went
before, been sufficiently declared. Secondly to the same, that the
lesser minerals cannot artificially be made the beginning of metals
which is Mercury. Therefore, also they do not thoroughly come into the
middle and end, which are metals and tincture, which it holdeth,
because nourishment in man, by generation cannot be made man, unless it
be first converted into sperm, and so being added to his like, a new
man is engendered. But because the lesser metals are of a foreign
nature from metals, although they participate well in some mineral
force, and are of a weaker virtue and combustible, therefore, metallic
nature rejoice not in it, but resolves and preserves those things which
are of its nature. For instance, if water be mingled with earth it is
separated by course, because the earth requires a bottom, for it is
heavy and dry, the water requires the upper part and cannot so
artificially be conjoined, that those contrary natures should stand
jointly in one nature. The water can well wash and purify the earth,
but it ought not to be believed that the dryness of the earth can be
changed into a watery moisture, although the earth becomes moist by the
water, so surely the lesser minerals may be conjoined with metals and
purge them and by some means bring in a new form into them, but nature
granteth not them to remain with them, and to make that ripe which is
unripe. Wherefore the ignorant bring in divers sophistical matters to
deceive men, that is unproportionate things which neither yield matter
nor also receive it, as the privates of men, the eyes of animals,
eggshells, hairs, the blood of a red headed man, worms, herbs, roots,
and man's dung. For many of the ignorant sort have laboured and do yet
labour in these vegetable and sensible things, where they have found
out no truth, but certain humilities which we will declare to the
ignorant that they may avoid the deceits. For they have extracted a
long time out of these things, afterwards to be spoken of, which they
call artificial Argent vive and oils and waters, which they named the
four elements, namely water, earth, air, and fire, and Salt Armonick,
Arsenic, Sulphur and Auripigmentum, which they could have bought
cheaper in the market and had sooner brought it to pass. They have
sought also in vegetable and sensible things, where they have found out
no truths, of dry things wanting moisture, of combustible and
corruptible things in which they have sought tincture, which they have
not, but those are damned by apparent loss. And these are the matters -
man's hair, the brain, man's spittle, the milk of women, man's blood,
urine, man's dung, menstruum and sperm, the bones of dead men, hen's
eggs, and simply in all brute beasts, in fishes, flying creature, in
worms, scorpions, toads, natural and artificial Basilisks, in which
very great trumpery is, in shells and in the juice of certain herbs,
flowers and trees, and especially in those, that is the herb of Lunary,
and Solary, which is called Toxicum, and in all things of which they
have feigned names at their pleasure concerning the metals, deceiving
themselves and others who were desirous to do the best matters with the
worse things, and to finish the defect of nature with such like things
whereupon it is said "whatsoever a man soweth that he shall reap", if
therefore he shall sow dung, he shall reap dung, wherefore it is no
marvel that scarce one among a thousand or no such men at all, bring it
to pass. Sow gold and silver, and it will bring unto thee most pleasant
fruit by thy labour with the help of nature, because that only hath the
thing which thou seek, and no other thing of the world, whereas all
other things are stinking and give place to nature by the continuance
and trial of the fire. And there are other Alchemists labouring in
lesser minerals, that is to say in four Spirits as in common Sulphur,
Arsenic, Auripigmentum, and Salt Ammoniac being desirous to make a
tincture but this they cannot do as is manifest by the definition of
the tincture. For to tinct is nothing else than by tincting to transfer
that which is tincted into its own nature, and to remain with it,
without any transformation, and nature teaching nature to fight against
the fire, for the nature of the tincting and the tincted agree. For
instance, if you tinct Lead or Tin, or any such thing from gold or
silver, this agrees in natures, because both parties have taken their
original from Mercury. The ripe is conjoined with the unripe, that the
unripe may be effected by it in such a way.</p>

since these four spirits are of another nature from metals, as has been
sufficiently spoken of, therefore, if they must be tincted, I demand
whether they ought to change or to be changed. If to be changed then it
is not tincture, as is manifest by the definition thereof. If to
change, therefore, in tincting it converts into its nature that which
is earthly and strange to a metallic nature. Therefore, they cannot
make metal by tincting, but that, which in tincting it converts into
its nature, is tried, because everything engendering, engenders his
like, and because this tincture is an earthly generation of four
spirits, therefore it will engender a thing like unto itself, which is
also earthly as itself.</p>

regard not that tincture, nor any other which is not found in the

laboured by the lesser minerals and such like.</span>

this our stone does now naturally contain tincture in itself, for it is
created perfectly into the body of Magnesia, but of itself it has no
motion unless it be brought to pass by art and operation. Geber says in
the operation of roots, "operation is used for this, that the tincture
of gold may be bettered more in gold than it is in its nature, and also
that it may be made Elixir, compounded according to the Allegory of the
Wisemen". But whether we need gold only and not any other body. Harken
unto Hermes speaking "His Father of the first composition is Sol, and
his mother is Luna". The father is hot and dry engendering tincture,
his mother is cold and moist, nourishing that which is engendered.
Therefore if there were not one of them in our stone the medicine would
never melt easily, nor gain any tincture, and if it did give, yet it
would not tinct, but in as much as it were, Mercury would vanish away
in a fume, because the receptacle of the tincture should not be in it.
But it is our final secret to have a medicine that melts or flows
before the flight of Mercury. Therefore the conjunction of two things
is necessary in our work. For Geber says in his Perfect Magistery, gold
is the most precious of metals, for that is a soul conjoining the
spirit with the body, that is with the imperfect, because as the body
of a man without a soul is dead and unmoveable, so an impure body
without ferment, which is its soul, is earthly and vegetable for that
is the tincture of redness, transforming every body. It is ferment
converting the whole mass or lump to its nature, because as Sol and
Luna overrule all the other planets, so those two bodies have dominion
over other bodies of metals, which are strongly converted to the nature
of the two aforesaid bodies. And therefore, it is called Ferment for
without it things springing cannot be amended, and as a little leaven
corrupts a great lump of dough, that is, transmutes and seasons it, so
in the same way, it happens to our stone.</p>

declare universally to all men, to whom these my present speeches shall
come, that in the bound of the whole art, there are but two particular
things which are particularly brought to pass according to philosophers
and nature. The first particular, as well in white as in red, is in
Mercury or in the administration of the perfect medicine, although the
body doth secretly contain in itself the tincture of it, with which it
is brought to pass as nature requires, because that is particularly in
it of either form of things. When as Mercury is compounded of the first
matter of all metals, of white earth too much sulphurous, and of clear
water. And therefore, the whiteness of the earth engenders the
clearness of the water and there is a most white colour in it, as
experience teaches us, and it contains in it good sulphur, perfect and
pure. Then it is possible that Sol and Luna be made of it particularly.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><b>The Philosopher:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Let
it be mingled with workmanship with other metallic bodies because it is
of the nature of them and they are engendered of it and therefore it
may be done by workmanship, and let it imitate the digested nature into
it, that it may be affected with them, so is made like unto them
without any foreign commixtion, when as it rejoices simply in the
nature of its nature, and not by any foreign thing. But, with Sol Sol
is made, Luna with Luna, Venus with Venus and so with all the rest.
When as every thing sendeth his strength into it and also because it
contains his good sulphur, but imperfect, which by art is made perfect
wherefore other metals coagulated by Sulphur particularly adjustible
[burning], as it cannot be made Sol and Luna.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">The
first reason: for if they should be transformed into Mercury and should
be mixed with Sol and Luna, then the Mercury of them would have in
itself that bad Sulphur, and if it should be purged then it would not
be purged into so much, which should reduce it into Mercury as before
such simplicity, neither also could the body be dissolved into it by
Mercury and when it cannot be dissolved then also it cannot send his
serated strength into it.<br>But natures being serated or ingrafted of
each part, every one is separated from the other in trial, when it has
not secretly in itself a perfect nature with which they might effect it
by the solution of them, but it is always necessary for them, by the
help of Art, that other perfect bodies should succour them, with their
nature which naturally is perfect.<br>Secondly, if the imperfect bodies
should be adjusted to the perfect bodies, Silver and Gold could not be
made, when as naturally the natures of them are locked in either part
by congelation, and when there is no mean opening, those natures to
send one strength into another, then they cannot be joined by natural
conjunction, so that they may return into Mercury from whence on each
part they took their original. And therefore by the vehemency of the
fire they are separated by course, by combustion of imperfect nature,
as is well seen. But when you will conjoin them, make Mercury by
Mercury, which dissolves and opens locked natures, that simply one may
pass into another, and the perfect send strength into the imperfect,
that it may be made perfect with it, and these are the labours of the
particular way, and so Gold and Silver may be made particularly.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Note
that raw Mercury dissolves bodies and reduces them into their first
matter and nature, but the Mercury of bodies cannot do this. That is
because of the rawness of its Sulphur, which it had in the first white
earth, with which it is made from the beginning of clear water, because
that [which is] raw does always desire to gnaw that which is nearest
its nature, first Gold, secondly Silver, etc., but the other Mercury
congealed of bodies cannot do this, because by congelation that raw
sulphur, which before was in it, is altered in nature, therefore it
gnaws not as the first, nor opens that which is locked. And therefore,
one strength is not sent into another, but everything remains by
itself, whereby surely they are fluctuously joined, but are naturally
locked in each part.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Wherefore,
by the trial and sharpness of the fire, the imperfect is burnt, the
perfect remaining, because one nature cannot help another, but this way
do it with crude Argent vive, that is to lock and open natures that
every near thing may be in aid to its nature. Therefore if Silver be
dissolved, he shall find a silvery nature, if Gold, a golden nature, if
Lead, a leaden nature. It is congealed by their Sulphur. Whereupon the
Philosopher says, "But if those bodies, which participate their nature,
as you seek in many stinking and unclean things and therefore it is
particularly possible on either part, for Gold and Silver to be made of
it, and not in other bodies as you hear."</p>

that there is a double solution of bodies into Mercury by Mercury and
into Water of Mercury. The first solution is required for particular
things, the second for universal things.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">The
first solution of bodies into Mercury is but a resolution, that is,
that which is locked by resolution only, and opened for the entrance of
one nature into another, and that is resolution in particulars.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">The
second solution is into water of Mercury and it is done universally,
and that is not done only by dissolution of unripe Sulphur into
Mercury, but by putrefaction of the body and spirit into moisture, when
as putrefaction is the solution and separation of all natures bound by
course, and so the parts bound are separated every one part from
another. And this is done by the separation and solution of the
elements, which in the generation of Mercury are connected, that is, of
water and earth and those parts while they are purged are joined in
nature by conversion, and loose themselves more for their cleanness
than before in nature, and this separation cannot be in bodies but by a
spirit. So art transcends nature in one way, although artificial things
may well be done suddenly, which naturally before took longer.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Do
not believe that these are common elements, that is to say, cloud water
and such like, but cold and dry earth, cold and moist water, moist and
hot air, hot and dry fire, and so are the Elements in Nature. But art
cannot so separate the connected parts in generation that they should
be simply transmuted into those elements, which they were, when as the
first nature has changed one quickly into another. In such way the Art
may well be separated, as moist from dry, and cold from hot but yet one
quality of the natural commixtion possesses the nature of the other in
some part, by those things with the help of art, they might be joined,
as they are divided. If that were not that one quality should
participate in the nature of another, that is, water participates in
the nature of earth in coldness, and air in the nature of water in
moistness, and so in all the rest, then it would follow that the
natural work would be wholly destroyed, when as the elements should be
be most simple, as they were before. Before the generation of Mercury
Art had destroyed nature, beginning from the head, that is from Gold
and Silver, even to the beginning that is Argent Vive and beyond those
principles of simple elements, according to that which they have been
before the generation of Mercury, so that it is impossible in Art. If
it were possible then it would follow that Art would make Elements
afresh, beyond the first matter of metals, and would again engender
Mercury as it destroyed it, which is impossible to be done
artificially. Surely Art is well destroyed from the head even unto the
feet, that is, edificating Mercury from the feet even unto the head in
a more subtle form with the substances of nature, which before was Art.
So the forms of things are divided, when as they are transmuted into
another form than that which they had been before. As Aristotle says,
"Let the Artificers of Alchemy know, that the forms of things cannot be
transmuted which is true unless they be reduced or converted into their
first matter, that is into Argent Vive, otherwise it is impossible to
be done."</p>

it has been before said, that Luna contains white Sulphur in it, as
Gold does red, yet the form of fire is hidden in it under the
whiteness. Therefore it is possible for all Silver to be made Gold.
Whereupon the Philosopher says, "It is not Gold unless it has first
been made Silver." So Silver contains in itself certain undigested
qualities, which may be purged from it by Art, so that particularly it
passes into fixed Mercury, and into the nearest nature of Gold, because
it then contains everything in itself that Gold contains, by the
apposition of the red Sulphur of Philosophers, with which it is more
digested, and the citrineness in it is caused in the joining of the
perfect body, when as they are simple of one nature. But this is
impossible to be done in other bodies, as they have not so great
vicinity or nearness to perfect nature, as that which is our impediment
in the engendering of them, by adustible and stinking Sulphur. Neither
are they of Mercury, of which the Philosopher speaks, "It cannot pass
from the last to the last, but by the middle." That is, Gold is not
engendered of Mercury unless it be first Silver, neither has it in
itself Sulphur of the simple fire, not burning, but burning Sulphur and
therefore they cannot particularly be transformed into fixed Mercury,
as has been said before by Aristotle.</span>

the Artificer know that they may make things like to them, and tinct by
red citrine, that it may seem to be Gold, and tinct white with white
until it be much like Silver. They may also take away the uncleanness
of Lead or of other sick bodies, that they may seem to be Gold and
Silver, but yet Lead always remains Lead, because it has not in it the
digested qualities of Gold and Silver. As those which take Salt
Armoniack or other lesser minerals to delude men, and join Copper or
Tin with Mercury, so that it may appear to men to be Silver, and
malleable in some sort, and are able to endure the trial in the fire.
According to them which are skilful in the fire, which nevertheless are
deceived in this, because it has not in it the silvery nature, as
appeareth in the colour and trial.</p>

first reason is, Copper contains in it Mercury, somewhat clean, in as
much as there is of Sulphur, but the Sulphur is stinking and adustible,
which burns it and has redness not well digested, but by reason of the
red and unclean Sulphur. While the Mercury has the substance before the
Sulphur, and therefore it goes more slowly in the fire, than Lead or
Tin, because Mercury resists not, but in as much as it suffers violence
of the Sulphur mixed with it, but that Lead is sooner burnt, that is by
reason of the infected Mercury. But infected Mercury with infected
Sulphur, is as Lead, seeks some moistness of its imperfection, and when
Silver and Copper are mingled in Silver it finds not any thing but an
infected thing. But in Copper it first finds burning Silver, to which
it is sooner mingled, and in the universal mixing, the Mercury is more
infected with Copper, when as Lead is infected in either part, that is
of Mercury and Sulphur.</p>

now, because more evil does sooner cleave to evil, so much the more
weak and worse it will be, and therefore sooner sticks to Copper and
Silver, infecting and burning it with the nature of Copper and Silver
as you have heard. On either part it is locked and cannot help the
worse, and so Lead burns the Copper from the Silver, which is more
slowly separated without Lead, because how much the more imperfect it
is, so much the more weak and combustible it will be. But in the
conjunction with Copper and Mercury, by some means it opens the natures
and conjoins these two, that is, Tin and Copper. Tin has clean Mercury
and bad Sulphur, weakly mixed, Mercury is joined with Mercury. And
Mercury hath always the power of Sulphur, by changing the colour of
Copper which is in Sulphur, so that a new form may appear, and may not
also quickly burn the Sulphur as it did before that Mercury. And when
crude Mercury is coagulated by it, it is altered with them in nature,
as by some means it may appear to be Silver, although in truth it be
not Silver. When as due digestion and decoction shall not be in it, and
Sulphur, not of a simple fire, and of a virtuous nature, as Argent Vive
itself, of which Gold and Silver on either part, that is of Mercury and
Sulphur, are sufficiently digested and of good ripeness, and perfect in
all digestion.</p>

you have the sophistical Silver of Copper, Tin and Mercury, and then if
you mingle some powders of the lesser minerals, it is not impossible if
Mercury has the government, but yet always when it is imperfect, it is
in the end diminished and burnt in the fire, when, as the Sulphur is
not of a virtual nature as the Mercury, but always secretly hurtful and
infecting the Mercury, although the Mercury be well furnished, and so
in the end it returns into dung, as it was before. Understand,
therefore, how the true Gold and Silver differ from the sophistical,
although many sophistications are made by the same manner by other
metals into red and white, adjoined with the lesser minerals or with
some one of them. But those labourers are deluded, when they think
themselves to have found the good appearance, their ignorance is the
cause of this, because they know not the natures of metals.</p>

the colour of redness is created of the accomplishment of digestion,
because blood is not engendered in man, unless it first be diligently
decocted in the liver. So we, in the morning, when we see our urine to
be white, then we know we have slept but a little and we go to bed
again, but after we have received more sleep, then the digestion is
accomplished and our urine is citrinated. So by decoction only,
whiteness may come to redness by continuing the fire in that way, and
our white Copper, if it be diligently decocted may be made perfect red.
Let it therefore be decocted with a dry fire and with dry calcination,
until it wax red like cinnabar, and put neither water nor any other
thing into it, until it become decocted to the accomplishment of the
red.</p>

say, because the perfection of every solution is drawn with subtle
waters, especially sharp and bitter, and with spring waters having no
faeces, as distilled vinegar is, and sharp grapes, sour pears, and
pomegranates distilled in like sort, and such like as these, but the
subtleness of them has been the cause of the invention thereof, which
have neither fusion nor ingression of which a great profit of the fixed
spirits was lost, and of those which are of nature, for everything that
is dissolved must of necessity have the nature of Salt or of Alum, or
of some such like as this. But it is the nature of them because they
give fusion or melting before their vitrification, therefore the
dissolved spirits will in like sort yield like fusion. Seeing therefore
they much agree with themselves in their nature and bodies it is
needful to penetrate bodies by it, and in transmuting to penetrate and
in penetrating to transmute, but it comes not to this without the
magistery, which is that after the solution and coagulation. Thereof
some one of the spirits, purified and not fixed, should be administered
to it and so often sublimed in it until it remains with it, and yields
it a more speedy fusion or melting, and preserves it in melting from
vitrification, for it is the nature of spirits and bodies not to be
vitrified and to keep the mixed from vitrification until the spirits
shall be in it. Therefore, the more we preserve the nature of the
spirit, so much the more we defend it from vitrification. Therefore, by
the work of nature we may prove that the grounds of Salts and Alums,
and of such like, preserving nature to be dissolvable, for we find not
in all the works of it any other thing to be dissolved besides these.
Therefore, whatsoever things are dissolved, must of necessity be
dissolved by the nature of them, by the reiteration of calcination and
solution. Therefore, we prove it by the fact that all things calcined
are near to the nature of Salts or Alums and therefore must of
necessity accompany themselves in the propriety. But the manner of
Solution is of two sorts, that is, by hot dung and by hot water, of
which there is one intention and one effect. The manner thereof by
dung, is to put it into an earthen body and to pour upon it a quantity
of distilled Vinegar, or such like, and to stop the head thereof close,
that it breathe not out, and to set it in warm dung, three days, and
afterwards let that which is dissolved be removed by distillation of a
philtre, but let not the dissolved be calcined again, until by
reiteration of the work it be dissolved upon all that. But the order
which is done by the boiling of the water, is more speedy, and it is as
calcined into a body. It is in like sort ordered with Vinegar, and the
hole is stopped that it fume not out, and it must be buried in a
cauldron full of water and straw, as in the manner of distillation by
water we have taken a precept by order, and afterwards let fire be
kindled underneath it, until it boil the space of an hour, but after
this let the dissolved be distilled. The melting in the middle fire by
which the Ingestion is made, is the last of perfections. As Geber says,
in his Seventh Book chapter 17, "Let all resolved things be coagulated
by the help only of the fire, and that in the vessel strongly stopped,
and keep this secret of mine, because the thing is perfectly
coagulated, if not, then begin the work again, and by reiteration you
shall come to your work again, by the help of God."</p>

nature of all melting things is of Argent Vive and of the substance of
it, because Argent Vive is proper to them, because it is coagulated of
vapour or of the heat of white or red Sulphur not burning. Whereupon
Aristotle says in his first book, "If it be white Sulphur not burning,
it congeals Mercury into good Silver, but if the Sulphur shall be pure
with clear redness, and if the fever of the fieriness simply not
burning shall be in it, it congeals into most pure Gold, better than
the mineral has brought forth." Because every dry thing does naturally
suck up his moisture, that it may be continuated in his parts,
therefore the vapour of the Sulphur of Argent vive is to be coagulated
of a subtle, earthy substance, decocted and undigested, from the first
commixtion, united unto it in the action of heat, afterwards elevated,
decocted and digested, until it has a sulphurous strength of
coagulating Argent vive into metallic bodies. Gold has much of the
virtue of Sulphur and but a little of the substance thereof, and much
of the substance of Mercury and little of the virtue thereof. Which by
reason of the Mercury it is very heavy and by reason of the Sulphurous
virtue it is very red. Silver in all points is in a contrary manner,
because it has much of the substance of Sulphur and but little of the
virtue thereof, and little of the substance of Mercury and much of the
virtue thereof. Therefore, it is white, because colour follows the
multitude of virtue, but virtue is placed in vapour, his matter is
nearer the matter of Gold, than any other metal, therefore it is more
easily turned into Gold. It needs no other labour but in transmuting
the colour and giving the weight.</p>

is a difference between the tincture of water and oil, because water
does only wash and cleanse, but oil tinges and colours. As for example,
if cloth be drowned in water, it is cleansed by it and when it is dried
the water goes away and the cloth remains in its state and in that
colour which it had before, but that it is more clean. And it is
contrary to this in oil, because if cloth be dipped in it, it is not
separated from it, by the heat of the fire, or of the air, unless that
be wholly destroyed, neither can the oil be separated from that cloth,
but by washing and by the dryness of the fire. But water is a spirit
extracting the soul from bodies, and when the soul is extracted from
those bodies, then it remains born in that spirit as the tincture of
things tinged is carried by the water upon the cloth, and then the
water goes away by dryness, and the tincture remains fixed in the cloth
by his oilyness. So therefore, water is a spirit in which the tincture
of the air is carried, which when it is brought upon the white foliated
earth, presently the spiritual water is dried up and the soul remains
in the body, which is the tincture of the air. Therefore, the spirit
retains the soul, as the soul retains the body, because the soul stays
not in the body, but by the help of the spirit. But when they are
conjoined they are never separated, because the spirit retains the soul
as the soul retains the earth. Whereupon Hermes teaches us that souls
are to be honoured in stones, for their mansion is in them. But there
are retainers of fugitives with them. Therefore it is our coagulation,
because they retain it flying. Sow, therefore, the soul into the white
foliated earth because that retains it. Because when it would ascend
from the earth into heaven and would descend again into the earth, it
will receive the strength of the inferior and superior.</p>

says, therefore, pour in water by grinding by courses and afterwards by
calcining it gently, until that water shall suck up the fiftieth part
of his water, knowing that first the earth must be nourished with a
little water and after wards with more, as is seen in the education of
an infant. Therefore grind much by imbibing the earth, by little and
little with water from 8 days to 8 days, decoct it in dung, because by
the inward moistening, the burning is taken away and the thing is
brought into his first matter, and afterward calcine it meanly in the
fire, and let it not be irksome unto thee to reiterate it oftentimes,
because the earth brings not forth fruit without much labour and
ploughing, and if the trituration shall not be good, till the water may
be made one with the earth, the body brings forth nothing. Therefore,
withhold not thy hand from the trouble of grinding and drying, because
it makes the earth white, but take heed that you imbibe not the earth
but by little and little, supply it with long grinding, after the
drying of the earth, then there is a weight in this everywhere to be
noted, that is lest overmuch dryness or superfluous humour corrupt it
in administering. That is, that you may decoct so much by drying as the
Dissolution has added to it, and dissolve it by imbibing as much as by
drying it is lacking. Therefore pour water over it temperately every
time after the calcination, neither too much nor too little, because if
it should be much, it would be made the sea of calcination, and if too
little then it is burnt into ashes or dross.</p>

work your earth gently and not over hastily, from 8 days to 8 days,
decoct it in dung and calcine it, until it shall imbibe the fiftieth
part of the water in it. And know that after the imbibing, it must be
moistened inwardly the space of 7 days, therefore begin the work again
many times, although it be long, because you shall not see the tincture
until it be accomplished. Study, therefore, when you shall be in every
work, to record all signs which appear in every decoction and search
out the causes of them, and bear them continually in your mind.</p>

every time little by little strengthen the fire in calcination, until
the earth come forth white by the strength of the fire, for as heat
working in moisture gives blackness, so working in dryness yields
whiteness, therefore, if the earth be not white, grind it with water
and afterwards calcine it again, because Azoth and fire wash Laton, and
do take the obscurity from it. For his preparation is always made with
water, therefore, what the clear water is, such is the clear earth, and
how much the more the earth shall be washed, so much the more white it
is. Therefore, by the manifold reiteration of Imbibing with strong
grinding and often drying of the wateriness of Mercury, the greater
part is consumed, that is of the wateriness, the residue whereof is in
like sort revived by the reiteration of Sublimation. These words
Arnoldus uses in his Rosary, word for word.</p>

when the earth shall draw out the fiftieth part of it from the water,
then sublime it presently with as strong water as you can until it
ascend upward in manner of most white powder. But when you shall see
the earth like pure white snow in whiteness, and as dead powder to
stick to the brims and sides, then reiterate Sublimation upon it again
without the faeces remaining beneath, because, part of that being fixed
does stick and would be fixed with the faeces,and can never be

the powder ascending upwards from the faeces is ashes extracted from
ashes, and earth sublimed and honoured, but that which remains beneath
is ashes of ashes, and the lower ashes is to be condemned and disposed
as faeces and dross. Make, therefore, a difference between the clear
and bright thereof, because when it is most white and ascends like snow
then it will be accomplished. Gather it, therefore, warily that it fly
not away in fume, because it is a good thing to be sought for, a white
foliated earth, congealing that which is to be congealed and cleansing
that which is to be cleansed, and purifying Arsenic and white Sulphur,

take, that of it they may make Silver.</p>

man ought to sublime earth for the works of sophisters but ought to
sublime it for the perfect Elixir, and those which are sublimed are
sublimed in two manners, or by themselves because they are spirits, or
with others because they incorporate in themselves with the spirits.
For Mercury when it is a spirit is sublimed by itself, but our earth
when it is calx is not sublimed unless it incorporates itself with
Mercury. Convert therefore the calx and imbibe Mercury and decoct it
until it be made one body and let it not be tedious to thee to
reiterate it oftentimes because the body will not ascend upward unless
it be incorporated with Mercury. Therefore it is needful that you
subtilate its nature as much as you can and strongly decoct it with
Mercury until it be made one, because we make not Sublimation but that
the bodies may be brought to a subtle nature and matter, that is that
they may be spirits and that the body may be light, to govern in every
thing, either in Sol or Luna, and this sublimation we make in order
that we may bring bodies into their first nature and matter, that is
into Mercury and Sulphur. Therefore we make this Sublimation for three
reasons. Firstly, that the body may be a spirit of a subtle matter and
nature; secondly, is that Mercury may incorporate himself with the
calx; and thirdly, that the whole may take the white and red colour.
Therefore when calx is sublimed to Luna it ought to be white and
Mercury likewise white, and Calx when it is sublimed to Sol ought to be
red and Mercury ought in like sort to be red, being made hot with the
fire and it ought to be an incerated powder.</p>

not the red Mercury to the white nor the white unto the red, but place
every form with his own form and put it to the fire being hindled and
sublime the whole and mingle not that which remains down below. After
you shall begin again to sublime by the incorporation of Mercury until
the whole shall ascend, otherwise do not put it into the magistery. Let
the Alembic wherein you put the Mercury be glazed and let the cucurbit
be of glazed earth, and let the mouth of the bottom be large that the
Mercury may ascend up more freely, but the Alembic must be joined with
the cucurbit so that the Mercury may not fly forth or evaporate away,
lest the Magistery perish.</p>

reiteration of the part of the sublimation of the unfixed stone, with
the policy of conjoining until it be elevated with it and again be
fixed with it that it stand. And when the order of the exuberance of
this accomplishment is reiterated oftentimes and the medicine is
multiplied more, the goodness of it is more augmented and the great
perfection is multiplied.</span>

precious secret is accomplished which exceeds all secrets of sciences
of this world, and it is an incomparable treasure, and then by great
diligence and labour, and continuance of earnest meditation thou may be
raised up into it, for with that thou shalt find it and not without it

unto us the series of all medicines with the experiences of it which by
the goodness of his investigation and by the instances of our labour we
have gotten and we have seen it with our eyes and touched it with our
hands and although we have concealed it under dark speeches. Yet let
not the children of Learning marvel at it, for we have not concealed it
from them, but we have delivered it to the improbate and the wicked
under such dark speeches, for that it is necessary so to do, yet the
wise and virtuous may by diligence attain unto it. Therefore, you Sons
of Learning seek after it diligently, for this most excellent gift of
God is kept for you only. You ignorant men and Sons of impiety and of
wickedness, fly from this science because it is an enemy unto you and
will bring you into the miserable state of penury, because by the
divine judgement and providence this gift of God is utterly hidden from
you, and altogether denied you. Thus for the words of Geber.</p>

of what kind soever it may be made subtle and purified, and his virtue
and effect by distillation may be bettered. We have spoken sufficiently
of the cleansing and purifying those things with which imperfect bodies
may be prepared and purified and be made more better and subtle by a
due fire always helping it, for they are prepared and purged by them by
the intention of the fire in this manner, for these imperfect bodies
have superfluous moistures and a burning sulphuriness and a blackness
ingendering in them and corrupting those aforesaid bodies. For they
have an unclean earthiness, stinking and combustible, very gross and
hindering impression and melting. These and such like things are in
these foresaid bodies which are to be found in them by our experiences
and politic investigations. And because these superfluous things
happened accidentally in these bodies and not radically therefore the
spoiling of those accidental things is possible, therefore it behoves
us to take away all superfluous accidents with artificial fire from
these aforesaid things, the substance only Argent vive and of radical
Sulphur remaining. And this is the full preparation of the imperfect
things and the perfect depuration cleansing, bettering and
subtilisation of these things or of this pure substance remaining is
done many ways, according to which the Elixir of preparation does want.
Therefore this is the manner of depuration in general. For first of all
the superfluous moisture is to be elevated with a proportionate fire
and corrupt in the essence of them and also the subtle and burning
superfluidity. And this must be done by calcining, then all the
substances remaining corrupt in the calx of the superfluous burning
moistness and blackness of them, is to be gnawn away with those
aforesaid clean sharp or bitter corrosives , until the calx shall be
white or red or coloured clean according to the body, the nature and
property, and pure from all superfluity and corruption. And these
things are cleansed with those corrosives by grinding, imbibing or
washing, but afterwards all the unclean earthiness is to be taken away
and also the gross and corruptible stinkingness with the aforesaid
things clean and pure nor having metallic fusion or melting purified
with the aforesaid calx in the aforesaid manner, commixed and well
grinded, which in the melting or reduction of the calx will retain
within themselves the gross and unclean earthliness, the body remaining
pure and cleansed from all corrupting superfluousness.</p>

ordering of the subtilation and bettering of the pure substance of
those things in general is this. First, this purged and redacted body
is again to be calcined with the fire and with the help of the
aforesaid cleansing things, and then is to be dissolved with these
things which are solutives, for this water being our Stone is Argent
vive of Argent vive and Sulphur of Sulphur, extracted, subtilated and
attenuated of a spiritual body which may be bettered by strengthening
elemental virtues into it with other preparatives, which are made of
the kind of its kind and by augmenting its colour, fixion, weight,
purity, fusion and all other things which appertain to perfect Elixir.</p>

Multiplication of the Elixir is made in two ways. The one is done by
reiterated solution and coagulation of the Stone. The second by
projection of the first Stone of Elixir upon the body either white or
red in such quantity that the same body may also be converted into the
medicine and let this be put together to dissolve in their water and
menstruum, and thus the first Elixir is ferment of such tincture and
thus the woman bakers do.</p>

it therefore from hence from a crystalline plate which you shall find
clear in the bottom and first grind it and cerate it with the last
inceration, by dropping upon it drop after drop in a crucible upon a
gentle fire of his white air until it be melted like wax without fume.
Then try it upon a fiery plate. If it resolve itself speedily like wax
then it is cerated, but if not then take and cerate it again drop after
drop of his white oil, until it be melted like wax without fume. And
surely this is the precept of all the Philosophers, that when you fix
the sublimed part into the most clean part of the earth, that then you
would reiterate the sublimation of the other part not fixed, upon that
which is fixed, until that also be fixed. Try this upon the fire and if
it give good melting then you have sufficiently reiterated the
sublimation, but if not then reiterate the Sublimation of the unfixed
part upon that, until it be quickly melted like wax without fume, then
extract it and suffer it to cool.</p>

now in the aforesaid chapter note diligently the zealous intention of
the Author in it how often he reiterates the manner of inceration. It
might have been sufficient to have repeated it but once, but because he
might the more strongly and deeply imprint it into the understanding of
the reader, therefore he repeats it so often, because in it the whole
strength of the Elixir depends. Consider also that Ceration, Fixation
and Sublimation are all one and their acts are alike, for by inceration
the spirit is fixed and the body is sublimed.</p>

but that only white water is to make white and red water is to make
red. Therefore mingle not the one with the other because you shall err
in so doing.</p>

until it melt like wax, and when you incerate it then mingle more of
the hot and moist thing than of the cold and dry. And when you fix it
then mingle more of the cold and dry things than of the hot and moist.

the perfection of this work. Note of the aforesaid things, that water,

principal manners of the Regimen are four. That is to dissolve, to
wash, to reduce, and to fix. To dissolve the gross into simple and to
make it subtle, to wash the obscure into bright, to reduce the moist
into dry, to fix the volatile upon a fixed body. To dissolve is to
divide bodies and to make the matter or first nature. To wash is to
inhumate, to distil and to calcine. To reduce is to impregnate, to
incerate and to impregnate, and to subtilate. To fix is to resolve,
conjoin and to coagulate. By the first the nature is changed inwardly,
by the second outwardly, by the third highest, and by the fourth lowest.</p>

we have fully entreated of the known experiences of the sufficiency of
the causes of this magistery, according to the exigency of speech
concerning our purpose, now it remains for us to come in one little
chapter to the accomplishment of the whole divine work and to draw the
dispersed magistery into a brevity of speech.</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">We
say therefore because there is no brief intention of the whole work but
that the known stone may be taken, and then with the instances of the
work the sublimation to be continued upon it, and by this it is
cleansed from the corrupting impurity and it is the perfection of
sublimation and with it the stone is to be made subtle until it come
into the last purity of subtleness, and lastly be made volatile. But
from hence let it be fixed with the manners of fixing, until it wax
quiet in the sharpness of the fire and here consists the second degree
of preparation.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">And
in the third degree the stone is administered in like sort which
consists in the last accomplishment of the preparation, that is to say
that you make the Stone which is now fixed with the means of
Sublimation, to be volatile, and that which is volatile to be fixed,
and the fixed dissolved, and the dissolved to be again volatile, and
again to make the volatile fixed until it melt and alter in the sure
accomplishment of Sol and Luna. Therefore the multiplication of the
goodness of alteration rejoices at the reiteration of preparation of
the third degree in the medicine. Therefore, of the diversity of the
reiteration of the work upon the Stone in his degrees, the diversity of
the multiplication of the goodness of alteration rejoices, that of the
medicines some of them transmute sevenfold, some tenfold, some an
hundred fold and some a thousand fold, yea, and some transmute
infinitely into the true and perfect bodies of Sol and Luna. From
hence, therefore, and lastly, let it be tried whether the magistery
consists in perfection.</p>

let him attend who desires to know the properties of the action, or the
manner of the composition of the greater Elixir, for we speak to make
one substance yet gathered out of many united together and fixed, which
being put upon the fire, the fire may not alter it, and being mingled
with melted things it may melt with them, it may be mingled with that
which is of an ingrossable substance in it and with that which is of a
mingling substance, and is hardened with that which is of an hard
substance and fixed with that which is of an fixing substance, and it
is not burnt of these things that burn gold or silver, and brings to
the consolidation with a due and perfect fieryness.</p>

you may not understand it so far in a short time, when in a four days
or hours it may be restored at the first turn, but that in respect of
the modern physicians and in respect also of the truth of the operation
of nature, but this is sooner ended. From whence the Philosopher has
said, "A medicine is that which in the long space of time has been
anticipated," wherefore I tell you that you labour patiently because it
is a necessity so to do, and surely hastiness is partly of the Devil.
Therefore he who has no patience, let him refrain his hands from the
work, because unbelief hinders him by reason of his hastiness.</p>

are three things necessary for this Art, that is Patience, Delay and
Aptness of instruments, of which we have spoken in diverse chapters in
the sum of this perfect magistery, in which we conclude with manifest
and open proof, that our Stone is nothing else but a stinking spirit
and a living water which we also name dry water, and cleansed by
natural proportion and united with such union, that it cannot be
separated from it. To which the third ought to be added, to abbreviate
the work this perfect body is attenuated.</p>

follows certain more notable things collected out of a little book of
one called Ademarus upon Geber the King of the Persians, and in the
fourth chapter where he says -</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">As
much as the Stone is cleansed by sublimation and by its burning taken
away by the extraction of the oil from it, and his flight is destroyed
by the fixing of it, yet nevertheless it is neither melted, entered
into, nor mingled, but it is vitrified, as it is in the seventh chapter
of Geber. Yea, rather it ought to be dissolved in the sharpness of
waters and be calcined many times as it is had in the sixty seventh
chapter of Geber.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Geber
in his sixth chapter says that by the manifold reiteration of Imbibing
and with light grinding and drying the wateriness of it, the greater
part is blotted out. This is therefore the Sublimation of the first
degree, by which the wateriness of Mercury is consumed afterwards in a
vessel body which is described in the twenty eighth chapter, that whole
substance must be sprinkled in the bottom of it and then let the fire
be increased as it is said in the third chapter about the middle of it,
until part of it excelling pure in whiteness the white snow, sticks to
the brims of the body, his whiteness being as it were dead. And this is
our Sublimation by which the earthly stinkingness and the parts of
Sulphur with the faeces remain at the bottom, and in it its nature is
purified, and from hence let it be fixed with the manner of fixing,
that is fermented, and then let it be set in dung. It follows until it
wax quiet in the sharpness of the fire, and this is called the second
Degree of preparation that is of Sublimation, but if it be demanded how
Mercury may be subtilated when in act it hath a most subtle substance
(as is said in the thirty ninth and seventy third chapters), where it
is said that it should be cleansed and subtilated by the manner of
sublimation or subtilation that is with sublimation of the first
degree. Therefore lastly let it stand volatile, that is let it be
sublimed with firing, so that it may ascend from the faeces as clear as
crystal to the brims of the vessel.</p>

says "make white Laton, that is earth, and lay up the books, that your
hearts may not be broken". And in another place: "Fire and water do
wash Laton, and wipe away the blackness of it". It follows therefore
that which is sublimed in the vessel Aludel, reiterate it one time,
that is fix it by subliming, as he says in his sixty-second chapter,
because a soft fire as it is said in the same place is a preserver of
the moistness and a perfecter of the fusion. Likewise it is said in the
thirtieth chapter that Argent vive ought first to be sublimed and
afterwards to be fixed.</p>

it is said in the twenty-eighth chapter that Mercury is fixed by his
successive sublimation, so that it may give metallic fusion or melting.
You shall find this self same thing oftentimes in his sayings. All
these aforesaid things ought to be understood of the preparation of the
first Stone and the whitening of it, before the putting of it in dung
because it must be so often incerated with sharp waters and be
dissolved and coagulated upon ashes, until it wax to soft and white and
in the end flow like bright Luna. For this is the sublimation of it,
that is into an higher dignity and virtue, and this is his true
purification.</p>

follows in the seventh chapter, but I counsel thee that thou begin this
work with imperfect stones for this hath been of the principal and
hidden understanding of that Geber. So you have in the seventeenth
chapter that the nature of Mercury is so in bodies as it is in Mercury,
yes in Mercury, yea rather it is most perfect in known stones. Likewise
it is said in the third chapter that the nature of mortified Mercury is
in Marcasite and meanly prepared which is of more force. That
Philosopher in his works, only means the nature of Mercury, but the
whole nature of Sol is of Mercury as it is said in the eighth chapter.</p>

to be fixable, surely no man that knows it.</p>

the Philosopher will have his stone to be fixed with the heat of the
fire, that the moistness of it may be preserved, but where is there a
more temperate heat than in the bowels of the earth. Likewise the
Philosopher will have his stone to be melted, therefore it is manifest
that the Stone is master of the Philosophers, as if he should say that
he does that even naturally by himself which he is held to do, and so
the Philosopher is not master of the Stone but rather its minister.</p>

the Stone is administered even in the third degree which consists in
the last accomplishment of the preparation, and it is that thou make
the Stone, which is now fixed by means of Sublimation, to be volatile,
and sublime it with the spirits not fixed. The fixed to be sublimed is
nothing else than for the body to be converted into a spirit which
secret is thus extracted out of the sayings of the Philosophers, for it
is had in the thirty-seventh chapter that the spirit is not mingled to
the body, that is to the fixed substance, whatsoever it be, unless the
Stone be first dissolved, and coagulated with the Magistery, but if you
demand how the Stone may be dissolved, we must say that it is done with
strong waters having briny bitterness and sharpness, being without
faeces, as the vinegar of wine is.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">But
if you demand why the Stone should be dissolved, we must say as is said
in the thirty-seventh chapter, that everything that is dissolved
getteth the nature of Salts and Alums, because salts only are first
melted before they are vitrified, and likewise according to their
nature those salts only are dissolved. If therefore our Stone be
dissolved then it gets the nature of Salts, but that which is melted is
ingrediated, and whatsoever does enter into, the same also transmuteth.
It is said in the fifty-seventh chapter that bodies are sublimed by the
most excellent degree of the fire until the fixed be wholly lifted up
with the unfixed as it is in the twelfth chapter, but if the whole of
it be not sublimed, then add a quantity of the unfixed part to it,
until it suffice for the total elevation. By most strong fire,
understand the fire of putrefaction, and of our Mercury, by the which
only the body is elevated, that is, converted into a spirit. Therefore
when it shall be lifted up, reiterate his Sublimation until the whole
be fixed by the administration of reiteration. And make the fixed
dissolved, that is, put it to vinegar as before, by reiterating all
four times as it hath sufficiently been declared, and make the
dissolved volatile as if he should say that by Solution the Stone is
made volatile and again make the volatile fixed. He useth these words
in his fifty-seventh chapter, as long as it yieldeth fusion and
melteth, and in the tenth chapter "Is this the Work for the white or
for the red?"</p>

the Lunary and Solary Stone are all in one essence, because each of
them is effected by means of Mercury only. There is also one way in
manner of doing it, because it is done by the same operations and with
the same order, therefore it is one medicine according to all

are certain by our investigation and we have considered by manifest
experiences that all these words are true which have been written by us
only in our volumes, and secondly we have seen those things by trial
and reason which we have brought into those volumes, but we have
written those things in the Sum of the Perfection of our magistery,
which we by our experiences have extracted with our fingers, seen with
our eyes and felt with our hands, therefore let the wise artificer
study in our volumes by gathering together our dispersed intention
which we have set down in divers places with the intent that it should
not be made common to the wicked and ignorant. And let him prove that
which he collects by studying and experimenting with politic instance
of labour until he attain to the full knowledge. Therefore, let the
Artificer exercise himself and he shall find. But we, to the intent we
may avoid the slanders of the envious, will declare it, because we have
not delivered our science and knowledge by the continuance of speech,
but we have sprinkled it in diverse little chapters and to this intent,
because if it should have been delivered in continuance of speech, the
improbate as well as the honest would unworthily have usurped it. And
for this cause, where we have spoken most plainly there we have most of
all concealed and hidden it, yet not under riddles and dark questions,
but we have spoken unto the artificer under plain order of speech and
have delivered it in the order of talk. Let not, therefore, the Son of
Learning despair, because if he seek it he shall find it, because he
that shall seek it by the goodness of his own industry shall find out
the science, but he that shall seek it by the following of books shall
very slowly attain to this most precious art, because we have declared
this art only to ourselves and to no other, being found out by
ourselves only that most true and altogether certain, since we have
expounded unto them the way of investigation delivered unto us, but we
have written that which is found to none but to ourselves only, but the
manner of searching and policy of means. Therefore, let the workman
that is of a good mind exercise himself by these things which we have
delivered and he shall rejoice that he hath found out the gift of the
most high God. Therefore, let these words suffice for the full
searching out of this most excellent art. So far the words of Geber.</p>

thus, for we must note that after the Stone shall be purified and
perfectly cleansed from everything corrupting it, and after it shall be
fermented, you shall not need any more to change your vessel, nor to
open it, but only to pray that God may preserve it from breaking, and
for this cause the Philosopher said, that in one vessel the whole
magistery is effected. And you must know that in forty days and nights
the work is accomplished for white after the true purification of the
Stone, because in the preparation there can be no determined time
unless the artificer labour well, and in ninety days and nights the
work is accomplished for the red. And these are the true times for the
full perfection. Understand this concerning Coagulation which is done
after purification, which purification hath nothing else to be done but
in the putrefaction and conversion of the body into a mere spirit, and
when thou shalt have this, praise God.</p>

must know that there is a certain oil of a golden colour extracted out
of the Lead of the Philosophers, with which, if you shall sublime a
mineral stone, a vegetable or an animal, after the first fixtion three
or four times, it will excuse you from all labour of Solutions and
Coagulations. The reason is because this is hidden which makes the
medicine penetrable, friendly and conjoinable with all, and it will
augment the effect thereof beyond measure, so that in the world there
is not a more secret thing.</p>

I speak things which are miraculous, which seemed to be incredible to
all the ancient Philosophers, that is, that thou shalt know well to
separate this oil from the wateriness and thou shalt labour in the
manner of the mixtion of them, and thou shalt be able to make the Stone
in 30 days, but this is not necessary by itself because the solutions
and coagulations of it (as hath been said) are quickly made and done.</p>

if the Sublimation of it should be made, I believe the tincture of the
Stone would be much enlarged. Out of these things therefore choose your
purpose. The reason of Galen whereupon Ixir or Elixir is made and he
says that diverse teachers put diverse medicines. Some say that Ixir is
of the minerals of mountains, some say of herbs, some of beasts and
urine. But it is made of one of those things, which is put in an
Alembic, and first the water comes forth in fume that is the spirit,
secondly Oil in liquor, that is the Soul, but the third which remains
in the vessel is earthly and it is called the body, for of those three,
spirit, soul and body, Ixir is made being so decocted that it may be
mingled and melted. Some say that Sulphur and Argent vive will become
Ixir if a man make them fusible.</p>

that neither water, nor oil, nor fire, hath his efficacy to tinct, but
it is first rectified by reiteration of reduction to the faeces and
distillations. We add even 8 to 10 times therefore, in all things as
well to be dissolved or fixed or tincted, or in any thing to be
effected there is a mean to be observed, because that intention in due
order doth ornament and accomplish a thing, that is to say that
imperfect bodies be duly calcined subtly washed and mollified, imbibed
or cerated and put to solution in manner aforsaid. But let the spirits
be subtly washed and purified and let them be put to mollification and
humiliation, and let those things that are hot and dry be dissolved,
calcined or sublimed according to that he shall see and it is judged
better according to the sound sense of the working.</p>

that it is Mercury cold and moist and God hath created all minerals of
it, for it is an airy element, flying from the fire. Therefore, when
any part is fixed to it, it effecteth an high matter and it is a
profitable spirit, and there is not any thing in the world but it.
Neither is there any thing that may stand in the place of it, and it is
a thing searching to the bottom in every body, and enriching it.
Therefore, when it is mingled with the body, it reviveth it and
illuminates it and converts it from disposition to disposition, and,
from one colour into another, therefore it is the whole Elixir of
whiteness and redness, and it is a permanent water, and water of life
and death, it is virgin's milk, the herb of washing and the animal
fountain, of which whosoever drinks dies not, and it is susceptive of
colour and a medicine of them causing them to take colours, and it is
that which mortifies, dries, moistens and makes hot and cold, and it
does contrary things according to the measure of its regimen, and when
it is quick it hath other operations, and when it is dead it hath other
operations of others, and when it is sublimed there are other
operations unto it. And he is a Dragon which marries himself and does
impregnate himself and he brings forth in his day, and kills all
animals with his poison, and the fire destroys him, and it destroys in
short time by reason of the Argent vive. Neither can he overcome it,
nor eat it, but flies from it. The former wise philosophers have
bethought themselves of the means of policies belonging unto it, until
by little and little it be made abiding the fire, therefore it does not
cease to be graduated upon the fight of the fire, and it is fed of it,
so that when any fixion is fixed to it, wonderful and strange mutations
happen because when it is changed it changes, and his blackness appears
and his sound and his brightness, therefore when it is tincted, it is
tincted and it tincteth; when it is dissolved, it is dissolved and it
dissolveth, and it whiteneth in the sight of the eye and it maketh red
in succession, and it is a water gathering together, and it is milk and
strong urine and mollifying oil and the father of all miracles, and it
is a mist and a cloud and fugitive servant, and occidental Mercury,
which hath preferred himself before Gold and hath overcome it.
Therefore Gold says unto him, dost thou prefer thyself before me, And I
am Lord of Stones enduring the fire. Our Mercury says unto it, but I
have begat thee and thou art born of me, and one part of me revives
many parts of thee, but thou art covetous and givest not any thing in
comparison to me, and he which shall bind me with my brother and my
sister shall live and rejoice, and it shall suffice him in all his
life, if he should live a thousand thousand years, and every day
sustain seven thousand men, yet he should never want, and I am the
whole secret and in me the Science is hidden, because I convert all
bodies into Sol and Luna, when my nature is such that I mollify the
hard, and make the soft hard. And therefore note that the Philosophers'
Stone for the true Alchemy itself is this thing only in the whole
world, and he which errs in this one thing is thought to run headlong
from the matter, but yet it is not perfect in his nature, to which
workmanship itself has brought it, for without the magistery it is of
no force with us nor of any commodity, neither does it perfectly yield
any thing but rather corrupteth, and this therefore I speak so far
forth as you use it with the magistery because it is pure phlegm.
Sometimes the Philosophers call it Sulphur and melancholy citrine, by
reason of the effect of his miraculous virtue, for as some men will
have it, of it God created all nations and appointed the original of
them for some men have called this our stone, white copper.</span>

Lucas and Eximenus say, understand all you that search after knowledge,
that no tincture is made but of our white copper. For our copper is not

whiteneth that to which it is associated.</p>

Plato says, all gold is copper, but all copper is not gold, therefore
our copper has body, soul and spirit, and these three are one, from
one, and with one, which is the root of it, therefore the copper of the
Philosophers is their Elixir accomplished and perfected of body, soul
and spirit. So the Philosophers have named the Stone by diverse names
that it might be manifest to the wise and hidden from the ignorant, but
by what name soever it is named, yet is it always one and the same
thing.</p>

Sublimation. Afterwards, they seeing the matter which ascended to
descend to the bottom of the vessel, they have called it Distillation
or Descension, moreover they seeing that substance or matter to thicken
and wax black and to give an evil savour, they have called it
Putrefaction. They seeing a black and dark colour and perceiving it
after a long time to cast forth an evil smell and a little whiteness to
come like the colour of ashes, they have called it Inceration or
Dealbation.</p>

whole magistery is nothing else but an extraction of water out of
earth, and a casting of water upon the earth until it be putrified and
this earth putrefies with water, and when it shall be cleansed, then by
the help of him which ruleth all things, the whole magistery is
effected. Moreover they seeing the earth to be mingled with the water,
and the water little by little to be diminished by reason of his
temperate decoction and the earth to increase, they have all said this
to be perfect Ceration. Whereupon the Philosopher says that the earth
is Cerated, Imbibed, and by the temperate decoction of the Sun, that is
of the heat, it is dried with the water and the whole matter is turned
into earth.</p>

they seeing that the whole matter came into a certain dissipation and
how it reduced itself to a hard substance, and because it melted not
but stood strictly, they have said that this was perfect Congelation.</p>

Plato says, dissolve our Stone and afterwards Congeal it with great
wariness as it has been demonstrated unto you, and you shall have as it
were the whole magistery. The same man says in another place, Take our
Stone and put it in a vessel and dry it with a light fire until it be
broken and afterwards decoct it at the heat of the Sun until it be
congealed, and know that the whole magistery is nothing else but to
make true solution and perfect and natural congelation. These are the
words of Plato.</p>

also says, Dissolve and Congeal and thus you shall know the whole
magistery. Likewise they seeing the aforesaid matter perfectly
congealed and thickened, so that by no means it resolved itself any
more into water, nor into fume, they have said that it was truly fixed,
because they saw that congelation and thickness or fixion, by reason of
the greater decoction of heat, to come into perfect dryness and
whiteness, and because that whiteness was beyond all other whiteness,
therefore they have said that this was perfect Calcination. They seeing
this matter to stand to its colour and to be changed with infinite
colours, because this could not be done but by the resolution of the
matter therefore they called this resolution Solution, for the elements
are discontinuated with that resolution, and they die and suffer. And
therefore the Philosophers call these elements, Man and Wife,
wherefore, the foolish and ignorant are shamefully deceived who believe
that the Philosophers' medicine is created out of any other thing, when
as the Philosophers say. "The Sons of Alchemy and others trusting to
all their Dissolutions, Sublimations, Conjunctions, Separations,
Congelations, Preparations, Contritions and other deceits, vaunt
themselves saying that there is no other Gold but theirs, no other
water but theirs, which is also called most sharp vinegar, no other
Dissolution and Congelation but theirs, which is made with a soft fire,
no other putrefaction but theirs."</p>

thee that my father Sol hath given me power over all power and hath put
on me the garment of glory and the whole world seeketh me and runneth
after me, for I am the greatest now they have known my virtue and
altitude, for I am only and alone which of his grace has given me that
virtue, and men seek of my servants that which is sought of me, and
they have not come unto it but through me, and the earth with all her
forces cannot make me humble myself. Yea, rather I am above it and
above my servants, until I humble them and extract from the nature and
power of them, and endue them with my brightness and fair light which
my father hath given unto me in all their works, for I am excelling,
which exalt and surpass all things and none of my servants can be above
me but one to whom it is granted because he is contrary to me, and he
destroys me, yet he destroys not my nature, and that is Saturn who
separates all my members. Afterwards I go to my mother who gathers
together all my divided and separated members. I am illuminating all my
things and I cause light to appear manifestly in the journey of my
father Saturn, and also of my mother who is an enemy unto me. But if
this should not be, I could not drink of the souls of animals and of
plants, but I come with the heat of the fire to expell the virtue and
iniquity of them from me. I am dwelling upon the face of the mineral
and I give to my servants of my extremities, and my name is called by
great names and he that studies in me cares not for any thing, but he
is not satisfied with me. I carry ships through the sea and I build
great cities and towers, seek not in me my greatness, therefore you
wise men I tell you that unless you kill me your undertaking shall not
be perfect and the degree of your wisdom increases in my sister Luna,
and not with any of my servants. And if you should know my secret, I am
seed cast into pure earth, which growing increases and multiplies and
it brings forth fruit to him that sows it, because every thing that is
engendered with his kind, doth multiply the form of his own shape and
of no other, as of corn there comes corn, and so of other things, and
in this I have expounded all the figures. Therefore, when I shall be
with my white pure moist and clean wife, I add to the beauty of her
face, to her goodness and virtue, for she is obedient unto me.
Therefore, when I shall be joined unto her, there is nothing more
excellent and better in the world, for she shall be impregnated and
shall grow and she shall be as I am in substance and colour, because by
this magistery the seed is multiplied, for of me, my like is born, and
when one grain of corn is sown in the ground, it springs and is
multiplied, grinded and seared, and is made into bread, of which the
whole world lives. And the mineral of the earth is made of me, neither
does it because it is the gift of God. I illuminate the air with my
light and make the earth hot with my heat. I engender and nourish
natural things, as plants and stones and such like. I take away the
darkness of the night with my power, and I cause the days to remain and
I illuminate all things with my light that are to be illuminated, and
those things in which there is neither greatness nor brightness, all
which surely are of my work when I am endued with my garments, and they
which seek me do make peace between me and my wife. Therefore, unless
she be separated from me and be mixed with inseparable mixtion, and
this may be done when you shall extract me partly from my nature and my
wife partly from her nature, and afterwards see that you kill our
natures, and we shall be raised again with a new and incorporeal
resurrection, because that afterwards we cannot die, for after our
resurrection we shall have everlasting glory and fortitude and then all
shall rejoice in great prosperity which know our proceedings.</p>

in this is the most precious gift of God accomplished, which exceeds
all secrets of sciences in the world, and it is an incomparable
treasure of treasures, because Plato says he that hath this gift of God
hath also the dominion of the world, because he hath attained to riches
and has broken the bond of nature, but not therefore because he has the
power to connect all imperfect bodies into most pure Sol and Luna, but
rather because it preserves and keeps every man and brute beast in
perfect preservation of health, and the crystal plate which is the
White Elixir, if as much thereof as a grain of mustard seed be given to
a man sick of the fever, it cures him. Likewise a leprous man, if at
four times in the year he shall be purged with that plate, with red
powder whereof Sol is made twice in one year in March and September, he
is cured. And both the white and the red powder heals the Sciatica in
the danger of death it heals also the palsy. Likewise if this be held
to the nostrils of women labouring with child they are presently
delivered, this Hermes affirms.</p>

also says that the red Elixir cures all cronical infirmities of which
the Physicians have despaired, and it makes a man become young as an

mustard seed. There is an herb which is called Saturnus de Canalibus,
of which such a medicine is made.</p>

therefore that all infirmities which are engendered from the crown of
the head to the sole of the foot, if they be of one month, then they
are cured in one day, if of one year then in twelve days, and if of
long time then they are cured in one month, for as it cleanses all
infected metals from all infirmity, so likewise it cures the bodies of
men.</p>

our blessed Stone is not unworthily called the greater Tiriacus, as
well of the bodies of men as of metals, of which Hermes, the King of
the Grecians and father of the Philosophers, speaks saying, if thou
takes of our Elixir every day for the space of seven years the weight

all other medicines of Physicians, for it rejoices the Soul, it
augmenteth virtue, it strengthens youth and removes old age, for it
suffers not the blood to be putrefied, nor phlegm to have dominion, nor

corporeal members efficaciously and preserves them from hurt, and does
most perfectly heal all infirmities, as well hot as cold, dry as moist,
before all other medicines of Physicians, because if the sickness be of
one year, it heals it in twelve days but if it be an old disease and of
long time then it will cure it in one month, and to conclude it expells
all evil humours and brings in those that are good, it brings love,
