Tis true without lying, certain and most true.

<br>That which is below is like that which is above
<br>and that which is above is like that which is below
<br>to do the miracle of one only thing

<br>And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one:
<br>so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.

<br>The Sun is its father,
<br>the moon its mother,
<br>the wind hath carried it in its belly,
<br>the earth is its nurse.
<br>The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.
<br>Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.

<br>Separate thou the earth from the fire,
<br>the subtle from the gross
<br>sweetly with great industry.
<br>It ascends from the earth to the heaven
<br>and again it descends to the earth
<br>and receives the force of things superior and inferior.

<br>By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world
<br>and thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.

<br>Its force is above all force,
<br>for it vanquishes every subtle thing and penetrates every solid thing.

<br>So was the world created.

<br>From this are and do come admirable adaptations
<br>where of the means is here in this.

<br>Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist [sic],
<br>having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world

<br>That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished and ended.</p>
